Rather, in their sentencing recommendation for fixer Michael Cohen, lawyers with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York wrote that in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, candidate Trump directed Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who wanted money to keep quiet about sexual dalliances. While such arrangements are legal, prosecutors argued that since the payoffs occurred during the campaign, they were violations of campaign finance laws.\n\nCohen, who is cooperating because prosecutors nailed him for tax evasion and bank fraud in his private business, pleaded guilty to two felony campaign finance violations. So no one has to talk about an \"alleged\" campaign finance scheme; there's already a guilty plea. But what was really significant about the sentencing memo was that prosecutors specifically said Trump told Cohen to do it.\n\n\"With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" prosecutors said. \"He acted in coordination with and at the direction of [Trump].\"\n\nThose words caused a sudden shift in the debate over investigating the president. What had been a two-year-long conversation about Trump and Russia instantly became a conversation about Trump and campaign finance.\n\n\"Prosecutors are now implicating the president in at least two felonies,\" said CNN.\n\n\"Federal prosecutors in New York say that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to commit two felonies,\" said NBC's Chuck Todd.\n\n\"At least two felonies,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n\"Implicated in two felonies,\" said anti-Trump gadfly George Conway, husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him,\" said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who will become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee next month, \"that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\"\n\nJerry Nadler, the Democrat who will chair the House Judiciary Committee, said the campaign finance charges \"would be impeachable offenses because, even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office.\" Nadler said he has still not determined whether the charges, even though they could be the basis for impeachment, are important enough to actually go forward, at least yet.\n\nNadler's public caution is understandable; his committee will have the responsibility of starting the impeachment process, if that is what Democratic leaders decide. But the fact is, a number of Democrats clearly believe they already have enough evidence to impeach.\n\nOne significant problem could be that the campaign finance charge against the president is a pretty iffy case. Back in 2010, the Justice Department accused 2008 presidential candidate John Edwards of a similar scheme \u2014 an alleged campaign finance violation based on a payoff to a woman with whom Edwards had had an affair (and a child).\n\nEdwards said he arranged the payment to save his reputation and hide the affair from his wife. The Justice Department said it was to influence the outcome of a presidential election.\n\nThe New York Times called the Edwards indictment \"a case that had no precedent.\" Noting that campaign finance law is \"ever changing,\" the paper said the Edwards case came down to one question: \"Were the donations for the sole purpose of influencing the campaign or merely one purpose?\"\n\nThe Justice Department failed miserably at trial. Edwards was acquitted on one count, while the jury deadlocked in Edwards' favor on the others. Prosecutors opted not to try again.\n\nPresident Trump would point out that the accusation against him differs in at least one key respect from Edwards. Prosecutors accused Edwards of raising donor money to pay off the woman. Trump used his own money, which even the byzantine and restrictive campaign finance laws give candidates a lot of freedom to use in unlimited amounts.\n\nSo even more than Edwards, if the Justice Department pursued a case against Trump, it would be on unprecedented grounds.\n\nBut the political reality is, it doesn't really matter if it is a weak case. And it doesn't matter if Trump himself has not been indicted, or even that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Because now, Democrats can say, \"The Justice Department has implicated the president in two felonies. Two felonies. TWO FELONIES!\"\n\nPolitically, that's as good as an indictment of Trump. Perhaps even better, since it does not give the president a forum to make a proper legal defense.\n\nThe last few days have seen a big pivot in the campaign against Donald Trump. For two-plus years, it was Russia, Russia, Russia. But despite various revelations in the Russia probe, the case for collusion remains as sketchy as ever. Now, though, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have given Democrats a new weapon against the president.

He paired the raise with the elimination of tax on overtime and end-of-the-year bonuses, and he encouraged employers \"who can\" to give bonuses as a way of helping to solve the social crisis in France. He also rescinded a planned tax on pensions that are under 2,000 euro per month.\n\nThese were among a wide range of demands by the yellow vests protesters, whose movement has gained widespread support after initially rallying against Macron's proposed fuel tax that was supposed to go into effect in January.\n\nMacron cancelled the fuel tax last week hoping it would appease protesters and put an end to the rioting and looting in many cities.\n\nIn the four weeks since they started, the violent demonstrations have caused millions of euros in damages \u2014 in Paris alone, the city estimated the Dec. 1 protest caused about 3.4 million euros (nearly $4 million U.S.) in damage. And NPR's Jake Cigainero reported the French commerce federation said businesses have lost at least a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion U.S.) in sales.\n\nThe president, who has been accused by the yellow vests of being arrogant, out of touch and committed only to representing the interests of the rich, addressed France's struggling middle class and pensioners in soothing and sympathetic tones in the prerecorded speech on Monday. He said he understands the anger against his government runs deep and has been decades in the making.\n\n\"I may have given you the impression that this was not my concern, that I had other priorities. I take my share of responsibility. I know I have hurt some of you with my words,\" Macron said.\n\nMacron's move to raise wages appeared to go against advice from Labor Minister Muriel Penicaud, who on Sunday told the Associated Press, \"there will be no boost for the Smic (minimum wage),\" because \"it destroys jobs.\"\n\nCigainero reported that French television station BFM TV, showed yellow vests protesters watching the most anticipated speech of Macron's presidency huddled around small television sets in makeshift encampments.\n\nOne of them, Alain Bouch\u00e9, acknowledged the president had made concessions but told the network yellow vest members will decide if Marcon's emergency measures will be enough to stop the demonstrations.\n\n\"If they're proposing it now, the government could have done it weeks ago,\" Bouch\u00e9 said. \"So why did they wait until there was conflict and violence?\"\n\nAlthough he admitted he is partly to blame for the protests, the president condemned the violence seen at yellow vest demonstrations. He said calm and order must reign.\n\n\"No anger justifies attacking a police officer, a gendarme, or damaging a shop or public building. When violence is unleashed, freedom ends,\" Macron said.\n\nHe ended the brief speech by saying he would meet mayors region by region to chart a new program.\n\nThen he addressed an issue that has not come up on the long list of demands by the yellow vests: He said his government would take measures to control immigration in what appears to be an attempt to prevent the narrative from being hijacked

Trejo also allegedly told the worried mother that \"he had lost his cell phone so she could not call him back later.\"\n\nRouhselang's mother then called police after continuing to search for the teen and contacting her friends, police said.\n\nInvestigators went to talk to Trejo again, \"since he may have been the last one to see or talk to Breana,\" but he reiterated that she was not there when he went to talk to her, according to the court document.\n\nPolice then instructed Trejo to send a message to Rouhselang's phone, to which he replied that he did not have a service plan and only had WiFi, police said. Trejo did have a service plan, the affidavit states.\n\nWBND\n\nWhen investigators surveyed the alley behind Rouhselang's home, they found glasses and a hat with what appeared to be blood on it, police said. They then located more blood throughout the area and located Rouhselang's body in a dumpster behind a nearby business -- a black plastic bag covering her head and upper torso, according to the charging document.\n\nPolice then transported Trejo and his parents to the station for questioning and asked him \"what he knew about last night and Breana's whereabouts, the affidavit states.\n\nTrejo stated that \"he had reached out to Breana for the first time in months to see how she was doing with the pregnancy\" and that she had agreed to meet him, but was not there when he walked to her home, police said. Trejo indicated that he waited around for a few minutes and then went home after Breana did not reply to a message he sent her, police said.\n\nDuring the interrogation, Trejo stated that \"neither he nor Breana wanted to have the baby\" and that he had no idea where she was, according to the court document.\n\nThe detective then informed Trejo that the physical evidence would not support his story and asked if he and Rouhselang had fought over the pregnancy.\n\n\"Aaron Trejo quietly said, 'Yes,'\" before explaining that \"Breana waited too long\" to tell him about the pregnancy for her to be able to get an abortion, the affidavit states.\n\nTrejo then allegedly admitted to stabbing Rouhselang in the heart with a knife he brought from home, police said. He allegedly said he chose to use the knife \"because he thought it would kill Breana quickly,\" according to the charging document.\n\n\"I took action....I took her life,\" Trejo allegedly told police, the affidavit states.\n\nSt. Joseph County Prosecutors Office\n\nTrejo told police that he then put Rouhselang's body in the dumpster and threw her phone and the knife as far into a nearby river as he could, according to the court document.\n\nTrejo also admitted he brought the black plastic bag he used to cover Rouhselang's head from home, knowing he would use it \"for that purpose,\" police said.\n\nHe had been planning on killing Rouhselang and the baby for about a week, police said.\n\nAn autopsy determined that Rouhselang died from multiple stab wounds and that her scarf had been \"tied so tightly that strangulation was occurring before Breana died,\" the charging document states. The manner of her death was ruled a homicide, police said.\n\nTrejo is charged with one count of murder and one count of feticide, or the destruction or abortion of a fetus, according to the court document.\n\nIn a statement, the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office said that \"probable cause\" was found to arrest Trejo.\n\nTrejo is being held without bond and will be arraigned on Tuesday.

In particular, the State Department report identified three committees within the government and state political party that censor media by restricting the sale of any foreign media, confiscating any that is found and punishing those who obtain it.\n\n\"North Koreans caught with illicit entertainment items such as DVDs, CDs, and USBs are at a minimum sent to prison camps and, in extreme cases, may face public execution,\" the report said. It went on to allege that one of those groups is responsible for kidnapping and imprisoning defectors and foreigners who share such items and promote human rights.\n\nWong Maye-E/AP\n\nTo punish North Korea for these abuses, the Treasury Department sanctioned the three officials, including Choe Ryong Hae, a close aide to Kim who is seen as the number two official in the country as head of the party's Organization and Guidance Department. It is perhaps the most powerful organization in North Korea, responsible for all policies and assignments within the party and military.\n\nThe other two officials are Pak Kwang Ho, head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, and Jong Kyong Thaek, minster of State Security, the government agency that manages the country's prison camps.\n\nJong is \"involved in directing abuses committed in the political prison camp system, where serious human rights abuses such as torture, deliberate starvation, forced labor, and sexual violence are systematized,\" according to the U.S. State Department, while Pak directs the propaganda meant to indoctrinate North Koreans.\n\nKyodo News via Getty Images\n\nBecause North Korea is already so heavily sanctioned and the three men are not likely to have U.S. assets that could be frozen, the action is largely symbolic.\n\nBut experts say it is an important reminder that the U.S. cares about the regime's human rights violations, even if the message has been muddied by President Donald Trump, who has praised Kim as a \"smart cookie\" and \"very talented\" and has said Kim \"loves his people\" and that the two of them \"fell in love.\"\n\nBruce Klingner, former CIA deputy division chief of Korea and now a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while \"Trump has not commented on, and seemingly dismissed concern over, North Korean abuses\" since the Singapore summit earlier this year, \"this sends a message that advocacy [for] human rights should not be abandoned in the quest for progress in security negotiations.\"\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEspecially on International Human Rights Day, the message is that, \"If North Korea doesn't change, doesn't stop its human rights abuses, then we can't engage them economically,\" David Maxwell, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told ABC News. \"We have to put as much pressure on that as we do on the nuclear program.\"\n\nBut the international pressure on North Korea for its human rights abuses could be slipping.\n\nFor the last five years, the United Nations Security Council held a session on International Human Rights Day to discuss the regime's abuses, which the U.N. has documented in detail -- including prison camps, forced labor, extrajudicial killings, rape, starvation, and censorship. This year, however, the U.S. did not win enough votes among Security Council members to hold the session again on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. mission is looking to hold the meeting in 2019, a spokesperson told ABC News, adding that the America \"remains deeply concerned with the human rights situation in North Korea, and we continue to urge the North Korean regime to join the community of nations, begin to respect human rights, and adhere to international standards on humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nDigitalGlobe/Getty Images\n\nTalks between the U.S. and North Korea have focused on the nuclear issue and little on those human rights abuses. In October, the State Department declined to say whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had raised the issue with Kim directly and argued that denuclearization was the priority.\n\nThe State Department \"is very clear about the concerns that we have, not just about North Korea but many countries, frankly, around the world and countries that can do a lot better. Our priority in North Korea, though, right now is denuclearization,\" spokesperson Heather Nauert said in October.\n\nCalling out North Korea now could anger the regime and further delay talks between Pompeo and his counterpart Kim Yong Chol, North Korea's nuclear negotiator and former spy chief. North Korea canceled meetings in New York at the beginning of November.\n\nKorean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP\n\n\"It's good to see the Trump administration paying attention to human rights abuses somewhere,\" Mike Fuchs, a deputy assistant Secretary of State for East Asia in the Obama administration, told ABC News. But both sides \"are looking for signs that the other is serious about diplomacy, and actions like this are more likely to undermine diplomacy than to further it.\"\n\nThat's debatable to others, though, who say North Korea will always look for an excuse to cancel a meeting and blame the other side.\n\n\"The North Koreans always bake in an excuse that they can use to back out of an agreement and blame the South or the U.S. or both,\" said Maxwell. \"If we are worried about that, we're never going to move ahead.\"\n\nThere have yet to be working-level meetings between the two countries, with North Korea refusing to meet one-on-one with Pompeo's special representative for North Korea, Steve Biegun, since he started in August.

Disney has already indicated it will stop licencing content to Netflix in favour of its own direct to consumer offer, a service which will have even greater appeal with the addition of Fox assets.\n\n\u201cOne implication of this consolidation is the effect on independent producers.

Not coincidentally, Canadian authorities are publicly discussing a similar ban following last week\u2019s arrest of Huawei\u2019s CFO.\n\nJapan\u2019s decision comes less than a month after the United States reportedly lobbied several overseas allies to block Chinese cellular hardware from their wireless networks, in part due to concerns over monitoring of U.S. military base communications. According to reports, the U.S. floated the prospect of financial subsidies for compliant countries, alongside the threat of reduced assistance to non-compliant ones.\n\nKyodo reports that the Japanese government complied, and is coordinating with top cellular providers to remove Huawei and ZTE hardware from their networks. Three carriers have agreed to stop using Chinese 4G equipment and not introduce new 5G hardware into their networks. A soon-to-be-launched fourth carrier has also said it will not use Chinese networking gear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely crucial not to procure equipment that embeds malicious functions including information theft and destruction,\u201d said Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary, noting that the country is now studying what to do with already purchased Chinese hardware. Top carrier Softbank has indicated that it will replace Chinese 4G cellular products with U.S. and European alternatives, while rivals NTT Docomo, KDDI, and Rakuten will avoid using Huawei and ZTE networking hardware in their 5G infrastructures.\n\nNotably, none of the Japanese carriers will stop selling consumer devices such as phones and tablets from Huawei or ZTE, as they are not believed to impact core network security. That\u2019s unlikely to change in the immediate future, giving users the ability to keep purchasing comparatively inexpensive Chinese products \u2014 albeit with potential security risks.\n\nHuawei has strongly denied accusations that its products constitute any form of security risk, and continues to offer its 5G networking hardware to carriers in South America, Africa, and Asia. ZTE was nearly forced to stop doing business entirely after a brief but hastily modified ban by the U.S. government, and actively turned its attention to pitching Japanese cellular companies, apparently without success.\n\nChina\u2019s government has responded forcefully to each of the international bans, most recently defending Huawei and ZTE in a statement (via Google Translate) ahead of the Japanese government\u2019s decision. But the protestations have generally fallen on deaf ears, and U.S. officials have continued to lobby friendly intelligence agencies across the world.\n\nNorthern neighbor Canada could be the next major U.S. ally to block Huawei from its communications networks. U.S. lawmakers lobbied Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a ban on Huawei 5G gear in October, but the government was largely quiet until shortly after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou \u2014 daughter of the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei \u2014 was arrested in Canada last week on charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nThough Canadian authorities have described the arrest as non-political, it brought longstanding issues with Huawei to greater attention in the Canadian media. Shortly after The Globe and Mail published a scathing opinion piece on Huawei, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for the company to be banned, suggesting that western allies needed to hold China accountable for \u201crule breaking\u201d that imperiled its trade relationships with partners. \u201cI obviously note that the United States is encouraging western allies to essentially push Huawei out of the emerging 5G network,\u201d Harper said, \u201cand my personal view is that that is something western countries should be doing in terms of our own long-term security issues.\u201d\n\nSoon thereafter, the Toronto Sun built upon Harper\u2019s comments in an anti-Huawei editorial, saying that the company couldn\u2019t be trusted to participate in Canada\u2019s 5G network. And in a separate interview today, Canada\u2019s Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told the National Post that the country is relying upon input from its intelligence services in deciding whether to ban Huawei, putting national security first in the decision.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no timetable yet for Canada\u2019s decision on Huawei, and Champagne has said that the issue is too important to be rushed, time is running out if the country hopes to deploy 5G over the next year. Huawei participated in 5G testing with Canadian carrier Telus in February, but by March, Canadian authorities began to question the wisdom of deploying Huawei 5G hardware.

This would make it the biggest Nintendo-published game launch in Japan ever, not including the Pok\u00e9mon series.

Last year, Splatoon 2 shifted 631,000 copies at launch and Super Mario Odyssey followed this up at the end of the year with 514,000 sales.

The spacecraft is now beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere, some 18 billion km from Earth. It's trailing twin Voyager 1, which reached interstellar space in 2012 and is now 21 billion km from Earth. Interstellar space is the vast mostly emptiness between star systems. Even though they are out of the sun's bubble, the Voyagers are still technically in our solar system, Nasa said.

That's because to get hydrated minerals in the first place, to get clays, you have to have water interacting with regular minerals,\" said Amy Simon, a researcher at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\n\nShe discussed initial findings from two spectrometers aboard the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft during a briefing with reporters at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington.\n\n\"Once you've made the clays, they can actually bond and store some of that water in there, make it water bearing, so these hydrated minerals have evidence of liquid water in Bennu's past,\" she said. \"So this is really big news.\"\n\nDante Lauretta, the principal investigator of the OSIRIS-REx mission, said the team targeted Bennu specifically because it was a good candidate for water-bearing minerals and possibly, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, a source of organic compounds necessary for life as it is currently understood.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" he said, \"we have not detected organics (yet). But it definitely looks like we've gone to the right place.\"\n\nNASA\n\nDiscovered in 1999, Bennu is a 1,600-foot-wide carbonaceous asteroid in an orbit that carries it nearly to the distance of Mars and just inside the orbit of Earth. Because it crosses Earth's orbit, it is classified as one of the top two most potentially hazardous asteroids yet detected with a 1-in-2,700 chance of impacting the planet late in the 22nd century.\n\nThe $1 billion OSIRIS-REx mission -- the acronym stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer -- was launched in September 2016 and reached reached Bennu on Dec. 3. If all goes well, the spacecraft will be maneuvered into orbit around the asteroid at the end of the year.\n\nThat will be an accomplishment in its own right. The asteroid's gravity is 100,000 times less than Earth's and it will be the smallest body ever orbited by a spacecraft.\n\nOSIRIS-REx is designed to study Bennu in unprecedented detail and to collect rock and soil samples for return to Earth in 2023. Along the way, scientists hope to learn more about what might be needed to divert or break up an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.\n\n\"The presence of hydrated minerals across the asteroid confirms that Bennu, a remnant from early in the formation of the solar system, is an excellent specimen for the OSIRIS-REx mission to study the composition of primitive volatiles and organics,\" Simon said in a NASA statement.\n\n\"When samples of this material are returned by the mission to Earth in 2023, scientists will receive a treasure trove of new information about the history and evolution of our solar system.\"\n\nScientists are already thrilled with the probe's initial observations.\n\nThe asteroid's surface, as revealed by OSIRIS-REx, is littered with boulders, large rocks and pebbles. Many of the larger boulders, some more than 150 feet across, appear to be lightly resting on the surface while cliff-like outcrops of larger rock formations can be seen poking upward.\n\nNASA\n\nAt present, the spacecraft's camera is sending back pictures with a resolution of 13 inches per pixel.

And it's taken just two centuries.\n\nBy 2030, Earth's climate is expected to resemble that of the mid-Pliocene, going back more than 3 million years in geologic time. Without reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions, our climates by 2150 could compare to the warm and mostly ice-free Eocene, an epoch that characterized the globe 50 million years ago.\n\n\"If we think about the future in terms of the past, where we are going is uncharted territory for human society,\" says the study's lead author, Kevin Burke, who conducted the work while a graduate student in the lab of paleoecologist John \"Jack\" Williams, professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We are moving toward very dramatic changes over an extremely rapid time frame, reversing a planetary cooling trend in a matter of centuries.\"\n\nAll of the species on Earth today had an ancestor that survived the Eocene and the Pliocene, but whether humans and the flora and fauna we are familiar with can adapt to these rapid changes remains to be seen. The accelerated rate of change appears to be faster than anything life on the planet has experienced before.\n\nThe new study builds upon work Williams and colleagues first published in 2007, which compared future climate projections to historical climate data from the early 20th century. The new study relies on extensive data about climate conditions to probe much deeper in Earth's geologic past and expand those comparisons.\n\n\"We can use the past as a yardstick to understand the future, which is so different from anything we have experienced in our lifetimes,\" says Williams. \"People have a hard time projecting what the world will be like five or 10 years from now. This is a tool for predicting that -- how we head down those paths, and using deep geologic analogs from Earth's history to think about changes in time.\"\n\nDuring the Eocene, Earth's continents were packed more closely together and global temperatures averaged 23.4 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) warmer than they are today. Dinosaurs had recently gone extinct and the first mammals, like ancestral whales and horses, were spreading across the globe. The Arctic was occupied by swampy forests like those found today in the southern U.S.\n\nIn the Pliocene, North and South America joined tectonically, the climate was arid, land bridges allowed animals to spread across continents and the Himalayas formed. Temperatures were between 3.2 and 6.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Celsius) warmer than they are today.\n\nFor the study, Burke and Williams -- along with colleagues at the University of Bristol, Columbia University, University of Leeds, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Center for Atmospheric Research -- examined the similarities between future climate projections as set forth by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report and several periods of geologic history.\n\nThese included the Early Eocene, the mid-Pliocene, the Last Interglacial (129 to 116 thousand years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago), the pre-industrial era (before A.D. 1850) and the early 20th century.\n\nThey used Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), which represents a future climate scenario in which we do not mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and RCP4.5, a scenario in which we moderately reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and climate simulations using three different but well-established models: the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE2-R and the Community Climate System Model.\n\nWhile not without their flaws, each of these models represents the best available data and state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nUnder both scenarios and across each model, compared to previous eras, the Earth's climate most closely resembled the mid-Pliocene by 2030 (under RCP8.5) or 2040 (under RCP4.5). Under the greenhouse gas stabilization scenario of RCP4.5, the climate then stabilizes at mid-Pliocene-like conditions, but under the higher greenhouse gas emissions of RCP8.5, the climate continues to warm until it begins to resemble the Eocene in 2100, achieving Eocene-like conditions more broadly by 2150.\n\nThe models showed these deep-geological climates emerging first from the center of continents and then expanding outward over time. Temperatures rise, precipitation increases, ice caps melt and climates become temperate near the Earth's poles.\n\n\"Madison (Wisconsin) warms up more than Seattle (Washington) does, even though they're at the same latitude,\" Williams explains. \"When you read that the world is expected to warm by 3 degrees Celsius this century, in Madison we should expect to roughly double the global average.\"\n\nThe study also showed that under RCP8.5, \"novel\" climates emerge across nearly 9 percent of the planet. These are conditions that do not have known geologic or historical precedent and they concentrate in eastern and southeastern Asia, northern Australia and the coastal Americas.\n\n\"Based on observational data, we are tracking on the high end of the emissions scenarios, but it's too soon to tell,\" says Burke. \"We may be somewhere between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, though if we increase our climate mitigation efforts -- like switching to renewable energy -- we could find ourselves closer to the low end.\"\n\nAbout a decade ago, Swedish scientist Johan Rockstr\u00f6m and colleagues introduced the idea of \"safe operating space,\" referring to the climate conditions under which modern agricultural societies developed. By comparing to the deep past, Williams and Burke say, we are able to better understand the planetary boundaries and thresholds that delineate this space.\n\n\"The further we move from the Holocene, the greater the potential that we move out of safe operating space,\" says Williams, a faculty affiliate with the UW-Madison Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research. \"In the roughly 20 to 25 years I have been working in the field, we have gone from expecting climate change to happen, to detecting the effects, and now, we are seeing that it's causing harm. People are dying, property is being damaged, we're seeing intensified fires and intensified storms that can be attributed to climate change. There is more energy in the climate system, leading to more intense events.\"\n\nIn their paper, the researchers try to strike a balance between alarm and optimism. On the one hand, Earth is headed into the unknown in our children's and grandchildren's lifetimes. On the other, life has long proven to be resilient. And, Williams says, in many places we are moving away from fossil fuels toward more sustainable and carbon-free energy sources. But more needs to be done.\n\n\"We've seen big things happen in Earth's history -- new species evolved, life persists and species survive. But many species will be lost, and we live on this planet,\" says Williams. \"These are things to be concerned about, so this work points us to how we can use our history and Earth's history to understand changes today and how we can best adapt.\"", "keywords": ["greenhouse", "geologic", "future", "eocene", "rcp85", "williams", "earths", "climate", "million", "reversing", "clock", "gas", "study", "50", "humans"], "summary": "By 2030, Earth's climate is expected to resemble that of the mid-Pliocene, going back more than 3 million years in geologic time.\nWithout reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions, our climates by 2150 could compare to the warm and mostly ice-free Eocene, an epoch that characterized the globe 50 million years ago.\nThe new study builds upon work Williams and colleagues first published in 2007, which compared future climate projections to historical climate data from the early 20th century.\nThe new study relies on extensive data about climate conditions to probe much deeper in Earth's geologic past and expand those comparisons.\nDuring the Eocene, Earth's continents were packed more closely together and global temperatures averaged 23.4 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) warmer than they are today."}, {"link": "https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/12/10/18134350/geminid-meteor-shower-2018-how-to-watch-time-date", "published": "2018-12-10T19:00:08", "title": "The Geminid meteor shower \u2014 one of the best of the year \u2014 peaks Thursday and Friday", "author": ["Dec"], "text": "We on Earth get to take in the wonder of a meteor shower typically when our planet passes through the trail of a comet.

It also behaves much more like a comet than an asteroid: 3200 Phaethon is a rare asteroid that forms a tail. (Some scientists speculate it\u2019s more like an extinct comet than an asteroid.)\n\nIts tail is likely due to its orbit, which brings it very close to the sun (in Greek mythology, Phaethon is the son of Helios, the sun god). The heat of the sun fractures the rock and creates the trail of debris that the Earth is about to barrel through. For this reason, 3200 Phaethon is sometimes referred to as a \u201crock comet.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, those asteroid bits are denser than typical meteor kindling, which means they move more slowly across the sky as they burn.

Sure, eating cookie dough can make you sick \u2014 but it probably won't.\n\nIt's estimated that only about 1 in 20,000 eggs contain salmonella. Bakers wishing to eliminate such risk could theoretically use pasteurized eggs (though that may mean sacrificing taste).\n\nAs far as flour, yes, there was an e coli outbreak in 2016 tied to flour that is believed to have caused 63 people to get sick, and it led to a General Mills flour recall.

On a protracted segment, the silver fox showed the MRI scans that prove extended exposure to screens and digital entertainment is altering the minds of kids. Those scans come from children enrolling in the National Institute of Health\u2019s first major longitudinal study of the effects of screen time, drugs and sports injuries on kid neurology. And it all sounded like a very big deal. Unfortunately, the report, which reached an audience of millions, didn\u2019t dwell on the small stuff.\n\nThis is not to say that the report was precisely wrong, but that the vector of reporting \u2014 the notion that brains might be changed by exposure to screens \u2014 overwhelmed the facts of the story to such a degree that it was hard to focus on what the researchers were actually saying. Dr. Gaya Dowling of the National Institutes of Health told Cooper, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being caused by the screen time. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d but the implication of the reportage remained clear.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt makes sense that Cooper and 60 Minutes are leaning into screen time reporting. As screens proliferate, parents are becoming more anxious about the hours kids spend in the blue glow of their TVs and tablets. At the same time, researchers are sounding the alarm. Some even say that screen time is this generation\u2019s smoking: a seemingly harmless activity that will turn out to have dire long-term consequences. There is science to support an addiction metaphor. Some kids who spend more than two hours a day with screens score lower on \u201cthinking and learning\u201d tests.\n\nUnfortunately, it remains unclear precisely what this means. Why? Because science takes time. Dr. Dowling can offer data, but is reticent to offer firm conclusions for good reason: We don\u2019t have the information to support them. What does that mean for parents? Essentially that they have, in queueing up Netflix, made their kids part of a culture-wide experiment in childhood screen exposure. It could go well! It could also go very badly.

Anyone who hasn\u2019t gotten vaccinated is urged not to wait until an outbreak, because it takes two weeks for maximum protection to develop.\n\n\u201cThis is a good opportunity to be vaccinated so it\u2019s on board and in effect by the time the stories are: \u2018Now there\u2019s lots of flu,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Luther Rhodes, chief of hospital infection control and epidemiology for Lehigh Valley Health Network.\n\nFlu-related deaths usually number between 3,000 and 49,000 per year across the United States, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. During the 2017-18 season, the number of deaths was closer to 80,000.\n\nPhysicians say the message is getting out on the importance of flu shots to groups at highest risk for severe complications: the very young, very old and those with other medical problems.\n\nBut there is that age group between about 25 and 45 who forego getting vaccinated. Maybe they got a shot once and still got sick, though that might have been a cold or the vaccine\u2019s protection had yet to kick in.\n\nThose who do get the flu can have symptoms such as a lingering cough for weeks, and can be forced to miss work or school with a fever that can last a week. Some flu sufferers develop pneumonia to the point they need medical assistance getting oxygen into their blood.\n\nThose infected with flu are contagious for about a day before symptoms begin.\n\n\u201cYou do this not just for yourself but you do it for others,\u201d Jahre said. \"That\u2019s the message we want to get across.\n\n\"At the very least, anybody who gets the flu, you know you feel like you've been basically run over by a truck.\"\n\nPennsylvania and New Jersey were seeking local influenza activity as of the week ending Dec. 1, 2018, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Local health-care providers will sometimes see a spike in flu cases right after Thanksgiving break among students returning to the Lehigh Valley\u2019s colleges and universities from visits to home, where they might have been exposed, he said.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened this year, which is good news, he said.\n\n\u201cBut again, flu is always, it\u2019s a viral condition, well-known to be spring-loaded to emerge at any time and oftentimes with little to no warning you have a sharp increase in the number of cases,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThere is flu, but it\u2019s barely a blip on the radar map locally and that matches the national picture, but every week we go into the cold months is a couple inches or notches closer to suddenly a widespread outbreak.\u201d\n\nMore good news is there are no red flags that this season\u2019s flu vaccine formula is a poor fit for the flu strains circulating. Supplies of vaccine are plentiful, and it\u2019s available at outpatient clinics, doctor\u2019s offices and pharmacies. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a \u201cFlu Vaccine Finder\u201d widget on its website near your ZIP code.\n\nThis year\u2019s quadrivalent vaccine protects against two Influenza A viruses and two Influenza B strains, while the trivalent formulation protects against the same two As and one of the Bs. It\u2019s available in a nasal mist for children and in a high-dose version for people ages 65 and older that, despite its name, doesn\u2019t come with a higher risk of side effects, according to Rhodes.\n\n\u201cI wish there\u2019d be a better term for it,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThe reason that there is a high dose is because it works better in individuals 65 and above.\u201d\n\nThe flu hospitalizations that St. Luke\u2019s has seen so far this season were all for Influenza A, said Jahre, which matches the national trend on flu strains circulating. In Pennsylvania, Lehigh and Chester counties have been seeing the most positive tests for flu, he said. In 2017-18, Northampton County was among the counties hardest-hit by flu.\n\nThese 15 Pa. counties had it the worst last flu season\n\nLehigh Valley Health Network this season is also seeing more cases than normal of RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. That is a flu-like infection that most often affects infants and young children and older adults.\n\n\u201cOur attack rate here, the number of cases, is as busy as we are in the middle of flu season,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBut this has been a particularly nasty year.\u201d\n\nThe advice for avoiding RSV is similar to that for avoiding the flu, with the exception that there is no vaccine for RSV.

He paired the raise with the elimination of tax on overtime and end-of-the-year bonuses, and he encouraged employers \"who can\" to give bonuses as a way of helping to solve the social crisis in France. He also rescinded a planned tax on pensions that are under 2,000 euro per month.\n\nThese were among a wide range of demands by the yellow vests protesters, whose movement has gained widespread support after initially rallying against Macron's proposed fuel tax that was supposed to go into effect in January.\n\nMacron cancelled the fuel tax last week hoping it would appease protesters and put an end to the rioting and looting in many cities.\n\nIn the four weeks since they started, the violent demonstrations have caused millions of euros in damages \u2014 in Paris alone, the city estimated the Dec. 1 protest caused about 3.4 million euros (nearly $4 million U.S.) in damage. And NPR's Jake Cigainero reported the French commerce federation said businesses have lost at least a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion U.S.) in sales.\n\nThe president, who has been accused by the yellow vests of being arrogant, out of touch and committed only to representing the interests of the rich, addressed France's struggling middle class and pensioners in soothing and sympathetic tones in the prerecorded speech on Monday. He said he understands the anger against his government runs deep and has been decades in the making.\n\n\"I may have given you the impression that this was not my concern, that I had other priorities. I take my share of responsibility.

He would have turned 24 on Dec. 12.\n\nJon Chol Jin/AP\n\nThe sanctions are also part of a congressionally mandated report that details North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's violently oppressive rule. In particular, the State Department report identified three committees within the government and state political party that censor media by restricting the sale of any foreign media, confiscating any that is found and punishing those who obtain it.\n\n\"North Koreans caught with illicit entertainment items such as DVDs, CDs, and USBs are at a minimum sent to prison camps and, in extreme cases, may face public execution,\" the report said. It went on to allege that one of those groups is responsible for kidnapping and imprisoning defectors and foreigners who share such items and promote human rights.\n\nWong Maye-E/AP\n\nTo punish North Korea for these abuses, the Treasury Department sanctioned the three officials, including Choe Ryong Hae, a close aide to Kim who is seen as the number two official in the country as head of the party's Organization and Guidance Department. It is perhaps the most powerful organization in North Korea, responsible for all policies and assignments within the party and military.\n\nThe other two officials are Pak Kwang Ho, head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, and Jong Kyong Thaek, minster of State Security, the government agency that manages the country's prison camps.\n\nJong is \"involved in directing abuses committed in the political prison camp system, where serious human rights abuses such as torture, deliberate starvation, forced labor, and sexual violence are systematized,\" according to the U.S. State Department, while Pak directs the propaganda meant to indoctrinate North Koreans.\n\nKyodo News via Getty Images\n\nBecause North Korea is already so heavily sanctioned and the three men are not likely to have U.S. assets that could be frozen, the action is largely symbolic.\n\nBut experts say it is an important reminder that the U.S. cares about the regime's human rights violations, even if the message has been muddied by President Donald Trump, who has praised Kim as a \"smart cookie\" and \"very talented\" and has said Kim \"loves his people\" and that the two of them \"fell in love.\"\n\nBruce Klingner, former CIA deputy division chief of Korea and now a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while \"Trump has not commented on, and seemingly dismissed concern over, North Korean abuses\" since the Singapore summit earlier this year, \"this sends a message that advocacy [for] human rights should not be abandoned in the quest for progress in security negotiations.\"\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEspecially on International Human Rights Day, the message is that, \"If North Korea doesn't change, doesn't stop its human rights abuses, then we can't engage them economically,\" David Maxwell, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told ABC News. \"We have to put as much pressure on that as we do on the nuclear program.\"\n\nBut the international pressure on North Korea for its human rights abuses could be slipping.\n\nFor the last five years, the United Nations Security Council held a session on International Human Rights Day to discuss the regime's abuses, which the U.N. has documented in detail -- including prison camps, forced labor, extrajudicial killings, rape, starvation, and censorship. This year, however, the U.S. did not win enough votes among Security Council members to hold the session again on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. mission is looking to hold the meeting in 2019, a spokesperson told ABC News, adding that the America \"remains deeply concerned with the human rights situation in North Korea, and we continue to urge the North Korean regime to join the community of nations, begin to respect human rights, and adhere to international standards on humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nDigitalGlobe/Getty Images\n\nTalks between the U.S. and North Korea have focused on the nuclear issue and little on those human rights abuses. In October, the State Department declined to say whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had raised the issue with Kim directly and argued that denuclearization was the priority.\n\nThe State Department \"is very clear about the concerns that we have, not just about North Korea but many countries, frankly, around the world and countries that can do a lot better. Our priority in North Korea, though, right now is denuclearization,\" spokesperson Heather Nauert said in October.\n\nCalling out North Korea now could anger the regime and further delay talks between Pompeo and his counterpart Kim Yong Chol, North Korea's nuclear negotiator and former spy chief. North Korea canceled meetings in New York at the beginning of November.\n\nKorean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP\n\n\"It's good to see the Trump administration paying attention to human rights abuses somewhere,\" Mike Fuchs, a deputy assistant Secretary of State for East Asia in the Obama administration, told ABC News. But both sides \"are looking for signs that the other is serious about diplomacy, and actions like this are more likely to undermine diplomacy than to further it.\"\n\nThat's debatable to others, though, who say North Korea will always look for an excuse to cancel a meeting and blame the other side.\n\n\"The North Koreans always bake in an excuse that they can use to back out of an agreement and blame the South or the U.S. or both,\" said Maxwell. \"If we are worried about that, we're never going to move ahead.\"\n\nThere have yet to be working-level meetings between the two countries, with North Korea refusing to meet one-on-one with Pompeo's special representative for North Korea, Steve Biegun, since he started in August.

Butina's case was brought by federal prosecutors in DC and not by Robert Mueller's team in the special counsel's office.\n\nHer cooperation will mainly focus on telling investigators about the role of her boyfriend Paul Erickson and her interactions with her Russian handlers. A spokesman for the US Attorney's office in DC declined to comment. Butina's lawyer declined to comment for the story. A lawyer for Erickson also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the agreement, revealed to CNN, Butina \"agreed and conspired, with a Russian government official ('Russian Official') and at least one other person, for Butina to act in the United States under the direction of Russian Official without prior notification to the Attorney General.\"\n\nABC News was first to report Butina agreed to cooperate.\n\nA plea hearing has been set for 3:15 p.m. Wednesday where a judge will need to sign off on the deal. The developments on Monday come after several weeks of hints that Butina might negotiate an end to her case -- and after bumps in the case where federal prosecutors, at the height of attention on Russia's influence in American politics, accused the former graduate student of infiltrating Republican organizations in order to advance Russian interests.\n\nUntil now, Butina, 30, maintained her innocence and insisted she was simply a foreign student interested in bettering relations between the US and Russia. Butina previously pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy and a second count of acting as an agent of a foreign government when she was arrested in July.\n\nPlea deal detailed\n\nThe draft filing of the plea deal notes that Butina relied on assistance from Erickson and took direction from her handler -- former Russian banker Alexander Torshin -- as she \"sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over US politics. Butina sought to use those unofficial lines of communication for the benefit of the Russia Federation.\"\n\nNeither Erickson or Torshin is identified by name in the draft but their details make them identifiable based on previously known information.\n\nButina kept Torshin apprised of her activities and her \"assessment of the political landscape in the United States in advance of the 2016 election,\" according to the draft filing.\n\nAt one point, Torshin asked her to provide a note justifying his attendance at the 2016 NRA national meeting. Butina \"did as he directed, encouraging his attendance partly because of the opportunity to meet political candidates,\" according to the document.\n\nEven though the draft court filing takes pains to outline her efforts to make inroads in conservative political circles, it also waters down other allegations prosecutors made in court.\n\nAfter previously casting her studies at American University as little more than a cover, the draft statement of offense notes: \"All available evidence indicates that Butina had interest in a graduate school education.\"\n\nThere's no mention of the sex-for-access allegations prosecutors once laid out in court filings -- only to them walk back later.\n\nButina's plea offer indicates she will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy, according to a copy of the document obtained by CNN.\n\nProsecutors estimated a sentence between zero and six months. Butina has already been incarcerated for five months, so the judge could decide to sentence her to time already served.\n\nHer cooperation agreement calls for her to turn over any evidence of crimes she is aware of, submit a full accounting of her financial assets, sit for interviews with law enforcement (and waive right to counsel during those interviews) and testify before grand juries or in trials in DC or elsewhere.\n\nIt also notes that, due to her plea, she will likely be deported.\n\nA politically charged case\n\nHer case first became public amid a furor of US-Russia developments. She was arrested two days after the Justice Department separately indicted Russian military intelligence for hacking the Democratic Party, and her case became public the same day President Donald Trump met with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declined to endorse US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nButina's case at first appeared to allege she attempted to do just that -- with prosecutors suggesting she offered sex to gain political access and sought out Trump campaign officials. But prosecutors later admitted they made an error in interpreting the text messages they used as evidence to support their claim that she was trading sex for access, drawing a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case.\n\nAt a bail hearing in July, in which a judge determined she should be jailed to avoid her fleeing to Russia with the help of Russian diplomats, her attorney argued that her case shouldn't be a proxy fight for US-Russian relations.\n\nIt is still unclear if Butina fits into a broader picture of investigations into Russian infiltration in US politics, however, or if she will agree to cooperate in other federal investigations as part of her plea deal.\n\nPrior to her arrest, Butina signaled she would be willing to cooperate with investigators on other probes, such as a fraud investigation in South Dakota into Erickson, who is an American conservative activist. Immediately after her arrest, she became unwilling to help.\n\nProsecutors in their criminal complaint accused Butina of ingratiating herself with politically powerful Americans and groups, including the NRA, and exploiting those connections to try to advance Russian interests. They alleged she was in regular contact with her Russian backers, including Torshin, a Kremlin-linked banker who has been sanctioned by the US Treasury and that she made contact with Russian intelligence. At one court hearing, prosecutors showed a photo of her dining with a Russian diplomat just north of the embassy just before that man, a suspected intelligence officer, left the US amid a purge of Russian agents.\n\nProsecutors said Torshin compared her to Anna Chapman, another accused Russian spy who was deported from the US in a prisoner swap in 2010, and that she tried to establish \"back channel\" lines of communications with American politicians and met Republican leaders as \"a representative of informal diplomacy\" before the 2016 election.\n\nThe contacts with Americans involved in politics lasted throughout her tenure as a graduate student at American University, according to prosecutors. They had cast her studies as little more than a cover for her spy work.\n\nBy changing her plea, Butina will likely be forced to return to Russia upon release from jail. She is currently being held in solitary confinement in a northern Virginia jail. She and her lawyer have repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, argued that she should be released on house arrest or at least moved out of solitary confinement.\n\nEven under scrutiny from federal investigators, Erickson has continued to visit Butina in jail. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "keywords": ["deal", "maria", "judge", "prosecutors", "cooperating", "federal", "plea", "torshin", "erickson", "case", "russia", "butina", "accused", "russian", "spy"], "summary": "Washington (CNN) Maria Butina, an accused Russian spy who nuzzled up to the National Rifle Association before the 2016 election, has begun cooperating with federal prosecutors after agreeing to a plea deal in recent days, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nNews that Butina had seemed to reach a deal with federal prosecutors first broke earlier Monday when her attorneys and prosecutors filed a two-page request on Monday for a \"change of plea\" hearing before a federal judge.\nButina's case was brought by federal prosecutors in DC and not by Robert Mueller's team in the special counsel's office.\nBy changing her plea, Butina will likely be forced to return to Russia upon release from jail.\nEven under scrutiny from federal investigators, Erickson has continued to visit Butina in jail."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/why-theresa-may-delayed-parliaments-brexit-vote", "published": "2018-12-10T17:30:00", "title": "Why Theresa May delayed Parliament's Brexit vote", "author": [], "text": "Addressing the House of Commons on Monday, British Prime Minister Theresa May delayed a vote on her Brexit withdrawal or transition agreement with the European Union.

May says she'll focus on getting improved clarity over what any border arrangement might look like if Britain and the EU have been unable to reach a post-Brexit transition arrangement when the transition period concludes on Dec. 31, 2020. Known as the \"backstop,\" and applying only if Britain and the EU had not agreed a trade deal by the end of the transition period, it would involve some form of border control at the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland border with the EU member state, the Republic of Ireland. But it's unclear whether gaining such clarity would give May the votes she needs.\n\nAnd it gets worse for May. Because while British parliamentarians want to avoid any formal border with the EU, the EU demands a backstop arrangement that would allow EU customs inspectors to check goods passing across the border.

The latest in a series of reports from the IPCC was released in October to measure \u201cthe impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.\u201d\n\nThe IPCC has maintained a significant presence throughout the U.N.\u2019s 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which is widely known as COP24. U.N. officials view the recently released IPCC report as a \u201cwake up call\u201d for conference participants to finalize negotiations for implementing the Paris climate agreement , which calls on participating countries to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Although 195 countries adopted the language of the climate agreement during a December 2015 COP meeting in Paris, the agreement cannot be fully implemented until after 55 of the countries responsible for producing a combined total of 55 percent of the world\u2019s emissions accept the treaty\u2019s terms, according to the U.N .\n\nMedia coverage of the intergovernmental panel\u2019s climate change report has made the case for \u201curgent and unprecedented changes\u201d built around emissions restrictions to curtail global warming that could lead to catastrophic conditions.\n\nBut the joint declaration \u2014 which was signed by Jaroslaw Grzesik, chairman of Solidarity's energy and mining secretariat; Dominik Kolorz, president of Solidarity in Poland\u2019s Silesian region; and James Taylor, a senior follow for environment and energy policy with the Heartland Institute \u2014 makes the point that \u201cthere is no scientific consensus on the main causes and consequences of climate change.\u201d\n\nThe Heartland Institute, which is headquartered in Illinois, has gained international recognition for challenging the premise of theories that link human activity with catastrophic levels of global warming. The free-market think tank released the latest version of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change at a media event last week in Katowice just as the COP24 meeting was getting underway. More than 100 scientists, economists, engineers, and other experts from across globe who have insight into the dynamics of earth\u2019s climate have come together to take part in the nongovernmental panel, which began releasing the studies in 2009.\n\nThey conclude that \u201c[t]he global war on energy freedom, which commenced in earnest in the 1980s and reached a fever pitch in the second decade of the twenty-first century, was never founded on sound science or economics. The world\u2019s policymakers ought to acknowledge this truth and end that war.\u201d\n\nUnlike its U.N. counterpart, the nongovernmental panel performs a cost-benefit analysis into the use of fossil fuels that highlights the benefits to humanity.\n\n\u201cDespite calling for the end of reliance on fossil fuels by 2100, the IPCC never produced an accounting of the opportunity cost of restricting or banning their use,\u201d the report says. \u201cThat cost, a literature review shows, would be enormous. Estimates of the cost of reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the amounts said by the IPCC to be necessary to avoid causing ~2\u00b0C warming in the year 2050 range from the IPCC\u2019s own estimate of 3.4% to as high as 81% of projected global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050, the latter estimate nullifying all the gains in human well-being made in the past century.\u201d\n\nSolidarity\u2019s willingness to defy climate alarmism while making a principled stand on behalf of sound science will reverberate across Europe long after COP24 comes to an end, James Lakely, the director of communications for the Heartland Institute, said in an email.\n\n\u201cPropaganda fades, truth endures,\u201d he said. \u201cSolidarity proved with its joint statement with Heartland that it will not be pushed around by the jet-set bureaucrats of the United Nations. I think that is the case with Poland as a whole. The people of Poland get 80 percent of their power from coal. Going 'carbon free' in the next decade or so will destroy their economy and society. The Polish people know this, so they will not be pushed around by the UN \u2014 nor should it, as Solidarity made clear in their meeting with Heartland.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\n\nOur planet is not in danger of catastrophe by the hands of man. It will shrug off humanity's contributions to current global warming via carbon dioxide emissions the way a buffalo flicks off a fly. Why? Because, historically speaking, our CO2 emissions are background noise.

The company has been racing to develop 5G technology and is central to China's plans to dominate the rollout of super-fast wireless networks\n\nThe company says its equipment is trusted by customers in 170 countries. And it still performs well, reporting $47.4 billion in revenue for the first half of 2018. That's an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year.\n\nWho is Meng Wanzhou?\n\nMeng, who is also known as Sabrina Meng and Cathy Meng, is Huawei's chief financial officer and serves as the deputy chairwoman of Huawei's board. Notably, she's the daughter of Huawei's elusive founder , Ren Zhengfei.\n\nAside from a brief stint at China Construction Bank, the 46-year-old executive has spent her entire career at Huawei. Her brother, Meng Ping, also known as Ren Ping, works at a Huawei subsidiary, and there was speculation that they were being groomed for succession. The Huawei founder reportedly shot that down in a letter to employees in 2013, saying his children lacked the vision, character and ambition to lead the company.\n\nWhat do we know about her arrest?\n\nJUST WATCHED Erin Burnett presses Trump official on arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Erin Burnett presses Trump official on arrest 03:28\n\nMeng is believed to have helped Huawei circumvent US sanctions by telling financial institutions that a Huawei subsidiary was a separate company, prosecutors said at Meng's bail hearing on Friday.\n\nThe hearing provided the first detailed look into the reasons behind Meng's arrest. The judge, after listening to arguments from Meng's lawyer and prosecutors, did not rule on bail and said the hearing would resume Monday.\n\nPreviously, details on why Meng had been detained were limited due to a press ban. A judge had accepted Meng's request to bar both police and prosecutors from releasing information about the case prior to the hearing. The ban was lifted on Friday.\n\nIn a statement after Friday's hearing in Canada, Huawei said: \"We will continue to follow the bail hearing on Monday. We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach the right conclusion.\"\n\nThe company has said it was \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng\" and that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.\"\n\nMeng's attorney said she would not breach a court order because doing so would embarrass her personally, and would also humiliate her father, Huawei and China itself. He added that the case against Meng had not been fully laid out, even though the US signed off on her arrest warrant months ago.\n\n\"This isn't some last minute thing,\" he said.\n\nMeng did everything she could to be transparent with Huawei's banking partners, and the company always worked to ensure its compliance with sanctions law, her lawyer continued.\n\nHow has China responded?\n\nMeng's arrest has struck a nerve in China. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 6 called for Meng to be released and for the United States and Canada to explain why she'd been detained. Two days later, China summoned the Canadian ambassador to address Meng's detention, calling her arrest \"lawless, reasonless and ruthless.\"\n\nState-owned newspaper the Global Times said in an editorial that the arrest shows Washington is \"resorting to a despicable rogue's approach as it cannot stop Huawei's 5G advance in the market.\" It said the move \"obviously goes against the consensus\" reached by US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade, who met over the weekend in Argentina.\n\nWhat does this mean for the trade war?\n\nThe arrest could jeopardize an already precarious ceasefire in the conflict between the United States and China over trade and technology.\n\n\"This type of action will affect the atmosphere around the negotiations \u2014 making them less likely to bring a sustainable settlement,\" Eurasia Group political risk analysts said in a note to clients.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday it was confident a trade agreement with the United States could still be reached in time to hit a 90-day deadline set by Trump.

But that speaks to something broader: the contrast between Russia and China's foreign policy doctrine, and that of America, is defining.\n\nYes, the world of 2018 is better than it has ever been. It offers historically unrivaled human prosperity, and a relative peace devoid of major wars of the kind that marked the 20th century. And thanks largely to American capitalism, our world benefits from constantly advancing technologies that make our lives happier and healthier. But to adapt a line from the HBO series, \"Game of Thrones,\" Venezuela also proves that the world is also dark and full of horrors.\n\nEven as we seek to change it for the better, foreign policy realists must accept this world as it is. We must do so because absent that choice we risk policies that damage our citizens' interests and make the world less safe. For the authors of statecraft the priority, then, is to balance the long-term advancement of national and allied interests with human interests in any one moment. The best examples of this balance are the best alliances: NATO, for example. Yet realism also requires us to sometimes work with unpleasant actors to achieve preferable long-term outcomes.\n\nEnter the Trump administration's relationship with Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is right to maintain close relations with Saudi Arabia even as we oppose the prince's worst impulses. American security, regional stability, and reduced Yemeni suffering all give weight to this righteous realism. It is the combination of these variable interests that make U.S. policy in Saudi Arabia the moral choice it is.\n\nContrast America's realistic balancing of interests with the policy applied by Beijing and Moscow in Venezuela. To be sure, as with U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia, China and Russia have valuable national interests in President Nicolas Maduro retaining power in Caracas. Maduro serves as a regional counterweight and frustration to both nations' primary foe, America, and the Venezuelan leader acts as an important oil-export ally. China needs Maduro's oil for its economy, and Russia needs Venezuela's influence in OPEC to support Moscow's output-price strategy.\n\nCrucially, however, unlike U.S. influence towards Saudi Arabia on issues like Yemen, neither China or Russia have any interest in influencing Maduro toward a greater morality. On the contrary, Xi and Putin are absolutely happy to see Venezuela's people starve, beg, and prostitute themselves just as long as Maduro does what they want him to do.\n\nWhat's equally telling is that neither Xi nor Putin attempt to hide their selfish disregard for humanity.\n\nJust last week Putin threw out the red carpet for Maduro as he visited Moscow to beg for investment. And Putin's whole offer of engagement with Saudi Arabia is built on the principle of absolute moral latitude.\n\nIn September, Maduro found similar friendliness as he visited China. In neither case did either leader privately or publicly pressure their ally to take greater action to reduce his peoples' grotesque human suffering. Predictably, Putin simply resorted to his worn KGB encyclopedia of trope-tastic un-realities. \"We support,\" Putin told Maduro, \"your efforts to achieve mutual understanding in society and all your actions aimed at normalizing relations with the opposition.\" Putin knows that Maduro's \"efforts\" have nothing to do with \"normalizing relations\" and everything to do with smashing the opposition. But Putin also knows his words lend fabric to his propaganda weavers.\n\nRegardless, all the world should pay heed to the divergence between American realism and Sino-Russian realism, because the two doctrines are far from similar. Indeed, their divergence speaks to a multitude of other international realities such as China's concentration camp industry and Pacific Ocean thievery, and Russia's treatment of Syrian lungs, and assassination adventurism.

With a few pointed words, the pair blew up the Trump administration's efforts to minimize the political damage stemming from journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\n\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said, referencing allegations that Saudi operatives dismembered Khashoggi's body after killing him in October inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican took aim at the White House's insistence that U.S. intelligence agencies had no direct evidence linking the murder to Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, even though it was carried out by members of his inner circle. \"You have to be willfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organized by people under the command of MBS.\"\n\nNearby, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told reporters there was \"zero question in my mind\" that MBS was behind the killing. \"If he was in front of a jury,\" said the Tennessee Republican, \"he would be convicted in 30 minutes, guilty.\"\n\nFrom the early leaks of its gruesome details to President Donald Trump's muted responses to Tuesday's full-throated rebuke from Republican senators, the Khashoggi murder has been an exercise in political mismanagement and discord. What could have been an opportunity to craft a unified American response has devolved into a political standoff, laying bare divisions among the White House, the intelligence community and Congress.\n\nFor weeks the Trump administration has tried to separate the crown prince from the horrific murder. It's also sought to frame the broader issue as a binary choice of either getting in line with its defense of Saudi Arabia or taking the risk of cutting off relations with one of America's closest partners in the Middle East. Even for national security hawks like Lindsey Graham, who is among the President's closest allies in Congress and is himself a long-time supporter of Saudi Arabia, that has been a bridge too far.\n\nThe Khashoggi murder has also worsened the tension between the White House and Congress over America's support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, which has turned into a full-blown humanitarian crisis, forcing an administration pushing for a cessation in the conflict -- and deeply opposed to congressional meddling on the issue -- onto its heels.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials reveal a deep frustration and anger over what many describe as the administration's bungled response, at home and abroad, to a searing murder that raises questions over the nature of America's alliance with the Saudis and US claims of moral leadership in the world.\n\nLast week, in an attempt to contain the growing outrage, the White House dispatched its two most prominent Cabinet officials to Capitol Hill. But the visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis appeared to do more harm than good.\n\nRather than getting a direct brief from CIA director Gina Haspel, as many had requested, lawmakers got a limited version that emphasized a technical distinction that the CIA had no direct proof that MBS had ordered Khashoggi's murder, despite the fact that the CIA rarely includes direct proof in its assessments.\n\nIt didn't help that lawmakers woke up that morning to a hardline op-ed by Pompeo in the pages of the Wall Street Journal. In it, Pompeo criticized \"the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on\" the murder had elicited, and equated critics of the Saudis with supporters of President Barack Obama's Iran deal -- a sentiment that, according to one senior GOP aide, landed \"like a lead balloon.\"\n\nThe frustration led to a bipartisan revolt for all to see, live on the floor of the US Senate. Minutes after Pompeo and Mattis left, a majority of senators, including 14 Republicans, voted to advance a resolution to curtail US support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen -- a resolution that had failed in March, and that Pompeo and Mattis had urged them to reject.\n\nA week later, Graham landed his own op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, in which he defended Congress' right to oppose the administration in order to \"safeguard the country's long-term interests, values and reputation.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Graham wrote, \"someone's got to do it.\"\n\nLeaks and infighting\n\nFor its part, the administration has condemned the murder and imposed sanctions on 17 individuals linked to it. At the same time, Trump and top administration officials have consistently cited the historic alliance between the two countries, and framed allegations of MBS's involvement as an attack that could threaten the relationship. It has rationalized that stance with what it claims is the lack of a final conclusion by the CIA on the question of whether MBS directed the murder.\n\nBut that rationale has deteriorated as a steady drip of details related to the CIA's assessment of the murder have painted an increasingly damning picture related to the crown prince's potential involvement.\n\nLast month, the CIA delivered a report on the murder to lawmakers in the \"Gang of Eight\"-- the chairmen and top Democrats on the two Intelligence Committees and the four House and Senate party leaders. When details leaked, including that the CIA had determined with a high degree of confidence that MBS directed the killing, Trump and White House officials blamed the CIA for briefing too many people, according to several US officials. In turn, members of the intelligence community were angry over the way that Haspel was thrust into the middle of a political fight between the White House and Congress.\n\nLast week as Pompeo and Mattis visited the Hill, Haspel's absence took center stage following lawmakers' claims that the White House blocked her from appearing. The CIA issued a rare on the record statement rebutting that, saying \"the notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's briefing is false.\" And multiple US officials pointed out that her preference all along was to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nWhile there is no indication that the administration told Haspel explicitly whether or not she could attend, several sources have noted that the White House had made clear, even if not directly to Haspel, that they did not want her there, and that she had little reason to push the issue as it would have only hurt her standing within the administration.\n\nWhen a small group of senior senators responsible for direct oversight of the agency and its funding asker her to brief them, Haspel had no choice but to oblige. Her appearance drew sharp statements from lawmakers who compared her briefing favorably to what they'd gotten from Pompeo and Mattis. Corker told CNN Haspel delivered the \"Most precise presentation I've ever heard in 12 years.\"\n\nDistance from MBS\n\nIn the leadup to this week's brief, the President and his aides watched angrily as leaks continued to emerge showing the CIA has evidence that MBS and a top aide involved in Khashoggi's murder exchanged multiple messages around the time of the killing. The details of those messages however have not been revealed.\n\nAt the G20 summit in Argentina over the weekend, images of Russian President Vladimir Putin backslapping the young Saudi prince were met with a certain degree of satisfaction among Trump's aides -- the best illustration, in their minds, of what it might look like should Riyadh turn away from the United States and toward other, more repressive, regimes.\n\nTrump's encounters with MBS at the G20 were purposely kept at a minimum. Advisers stacked the President's agenda with meetings, making little time for extended discussions with the crown prince. When the two did run across each other on the margins of a group meeting, there was little time for detailed talks. The discussion was cordial, one person familiar with it said, and not the type of direct confrontation that French President Emmanuel Macron employed when he ran across MBS at the summit.\n\nCongress ignored\n\nAnimating much of the anger among lawmakers over the Khashoggi affair is the sense that they have been ignored throughout the process. According to interviews with more than a dozen senators and aides, at the heart of the split was the administration's refusal to budge when concerns were raised about the murder, as well as the growing crisis in Yemen. As many as 14 million Yemenis are suffering severe food shortages, aid agencies say, while an estimated 85,000 children under the age of 5 may have already died of starvation or disease, according to Save the Children.\n\nCorker made clear he had no desire to support the resolution cutting off US military aid for Saudi operations in Yemen. For days he pleaded with the administration, privately and publicly, to change course. A statement. A more active policy response. Something to send a message to the young Saudi crown prince. But nothing came., so he voted to support the resolution even though he opposed its intent.\n\nWhile Corker has frequently clashed with Trump, the administration's accommodating posture toward Saudi has turned even some of its strongest allies into critics. Sen. Todd Young is a prime example. An Indiana Republican and Naval Academy graduate, Young is known to be a staunch national security hawk -- and he said recently he \"will take a backseat to no one as an Iran hawk\" -- but for nearly two years he has made a primary focus the expanding humanitarian crisis in Yemen and pressuring the administration to change the conflict's trajectory.\n\nHe is also known to be press shy, avoiding hallway interviews with reporters and rarely weighing in on issues unless he has a specific point to make.\n\nThat changed shortly before Pompeo's briefing, when Young and an aide walked up to a group of reporters standing near a bank of cameras and said he wanted to make an on-camera statement. He ended up taking to the Senate floor instead, where he unleashed a blistering speech.\n\nYoung noted the administration, for months, had not taken seriously a statutory requirement to certify that the government of Saudi Arabia was taking steps to end the civil war in Yemen and the resulting humanitarian crisis. The certification the administration had sent \u2014 which was required by a measure Young had helped craft and push into law \u2014 \"was not credible,\" he said on the floor. \"Despite repeated requests for answers to our questions regarding Saudi Arabia and Yemen, we couldn't get responsive or timely answers from the administration.\"\n\nYoung then detailed a bipartisan follow-up letter, which asked the administration for clarifications about clear inconsistencies in its certification. It had been ignored until the day before Pompeo's briefing, when the administration, belatedly recognizing the trouble it was in on the Yemen resolution vote, finally replied. As to how it was received: \"It was late, and it was unresponsive,\" Young said. He too would join Corker in supporting the Yemen measure he had previously opposed, he said.\n\nWhat can Congress do?\n\nWhile most of the roughly dozen senators who were briefed by Haspel said the US should issue a response punishing those involved in Khashoggi's murder, there is not yet consensus on what to do, or even if Congress has the bandwidth to pass anything with teeth. The Republican-led House has made clear it won't take up anything the Senate sends its way. There's less than a month to go on the current session of Congress, and of course, the President could veto any bill sent his way.\n\nWednesday night, Graham -- along with Sens. Marco Rubio, Dianne Feinstein, Ed Markey, Todd Young and Chris Coons -- introduced a strongly worded though non-binding resolution condemning the crown prince for a range of actions, including the crisis in Yemen, the blockade in Qatar, the jailing of dissidents and the killing of Khashoggi. The measure is a symbolic rebuke -- and could be added to a broader package targeting Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Those who suggest we must sacrifice our principles for security will have neither,\" said Young, a Republican from Indiana.\n\nGraham and Young, along with Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, are pushing a separate bill to require mandatory sanctions on any individual responsible for the death of Khashoggi, which could include MBS. It also, among other provisions, would call for a total prohibition on sales of arms to Saudi Arabia that could be used for offensive purposes -- a potential flashpoint for a President who has repeatedly touted arm sales to the kingdom as he describes the US-Saudi relationship.\n\nDiscussions are ongoing about whether to go for an up or down vote on the Senate floor for the resolution curtailing US support for the war in Yemen, or whether to open the floor up to a potentially unruly amendment process. Corker is crafting an amendment that would directly address the Khashogi issue, and potentially separate it from Yemen. Senate aides say the process remains fluid, as meetings across Capitol Hill continue behind closed doors.\n\nThe real importance of congressional action, senators and aides involved in the efforts say, is the message it sends to the world, particularly as the parties negotiate in Sweden over a ceasefire. Pompeo has emphasized the importance of giving the warring parties in Yemen the space to reach a deal rather than piling on pressure from Congress. \"The more support from you we get the better chance we have of ending the conflict and stopping the suffering that none of us are happy about.\"\n\nThe administration's efforts on that front haven't just been confined to Congress. CNN reported last month that the US had \"slammed the brakes on\" a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a limited ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Yemen, over concerns about angering Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe White House's defense of Saudi -- and its explicit support for MBS -- shows no signs of abating, a calculation defined by the long-standing relationship and its value to countering foes like Iran. Recent weeks have shown that it is a stance, however firm, that could come at a cost. Already some of Capitol Hill's stalwart Trump supporters have broken with the President and his Cabinet on this issue. Graham, a Trump golfing partner and vocal supporter of the President and his top lieutenants, went so far as to accuse Pompeo and Mattis of willful ignorance. \"I think the reason they don't draw the conclusion that (MBS) is complicit is because the administration doesn't want to go down that road.\"", "keywords": ["trumps", "khashoggi", "pompeo", "white", "disaster", "cia", "young", "saudi", "administration", "yemen", "mbs", "slowmotion", "strategy", "president", "murder"], "summary": "Nearby, Republican Sen.

If meditation is meant to make practitioners more aware and compassionate, Dorsey\u2019s practice appears to have failed on that front.\n\nIt fell short in other areas, too.\n\nIn a tweet thread, Dorsey talks about his experience in a monastery and the idea behind Vipassana meditation, which is to \u201cknow thyself,\u201d cultivate detachment from desire, and thereby minimize suffering. \u201dDuring the 10 days: no devices, reading, writing, physical exercise, music, intoxicants, meat, talking, or even eye contact with others. It\u2019s free: everything is given to meditators by charity,\u201d Dorsey explains.\n\nYet, he did wear his Apple Watch and Oura Ring, a sleep tracker, measuring his physiological responses to this philosophical project.\n\nThe problem with this\u2014apart from indicating Dorsey\u2019s inability to truly detach from technology\u2014is that it misses the point of the very practice he was engaged in. Spiritual practice can\u2019t be measured, not in quantifiable terms, and the notion of \u201cbest meditations\u201d is problematic. The Buddha covered this precise point millennia ago, stating:\n\nJust as when a carpenter or carpenter\u2019s apprentice sees the marks of his fingers or thumb on the handle of his adze but does not know, \u2018Today my adze handle wore down this much, or yesterday it wore down that much, or the day before yesterday it wore down this much,\u2019 still he knows it is worn through when it is worn through. In the same way, when a monk dwells devoting himself to development, he does not know, \u2018Today my effluents wore down this much, or yesterday they wore down that much, or the day before yesterday they wore down this much,\u2019 still he knows they are worn through when they are worn through.\n\nIn other words, there is no physical measure of \u201csuccess\u201d in meditative practice. And Dorsey is quite intent on characterizing his meditations as more or less successful, best and worst. He writes, \u201cThe 2nd day was my best. I was able to focus entirely on my breath, without thoughts, for over an hour. The most I could do before that was 5 minutes. Day 6 was my worst as I caught a nasty cold going around the center. Couldn\u2019t sleep from then on but pushed through til the end.\u201d\n\nWhat this admission reveals is that 10 days of silent meditation in a monastery in Myanmar didn\u2019t teach Dorsey too much about detachment from notions of gain or loss, which the Buddha considered to be among the primary causes of human suffering. It indicates that he never stopped thinking about time or trying to accomplish something specific from his practice. And that\u2019s definitive proof of attachment.\n\nDorsey remained obsessed with quantification. \u201cWe also meditated in a cave in Mandalay one evening. In the first 10 minutes I got bit 117 times by mosquitoes,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey left me alone when the light blew a fuse, which you can see in my heart rate lowering.\u201d Even if the number of mosquito bites he notes is a joke\u2014though who knows, maybe he counted?\u2014he\u2019s focusing on some of the pitfalls of practice.\n\nIndeed, if Dorsey\u2019s retreat had really \u201csucceeded\u201d he probably would not have tweeted about it at all. And we\u2019d have nothing to criticize because he would have realized that he doesn\u2019t need to publicize his activities in order to confirm his existence and gain the approval of others.\n\nWhile Dorsey arguably may have wanted to share the benefits of meditation with the masses\u2014just in case you haven\u2019t heard about it yet\u2014his thread undermined the very lessons he intended to learn and pass on to others.\n\n\u201cThe highlight of my trip was serving monks and nuns food, and donating sandals and umbrellas,\u201d he writes.\n\nBut true humility doesn\u2019t advertise itself or call attention to the good deeds of the doer. Dorsey\u2019s revelation seems mostly to serve himself, to fortify the ego he ostensibly seeks to dissolve.\n\nIn his seminal 1973 essay, \u201cCutting Through Spiritual Materialism\u201d about the pitfalls of meditative practice, Buddhist monk and meditation master Chogyam Trungpa warned, \u201cEgo is able to convert everything to its own use, even spirituality. For example, if you have learned of a particularly beneficial meditation technique of spiritual practice, then ego\u2019s attitude is, first to regard it as an object of fascination and, second to examine it.\u201d\n\nDorsey\u2019s tweets seem to illuminate these lessons. He\u2019s fascinated by his spiritual project and analytical about its effects and success. Ultimately, he appears to be putting on a show (mostly for his own benefit) and not cutting through his materialism. Trungpa warned against this, writing. \u201cWhen we have learned all the tricks and answers of the spiritual game, we automatically try to imitate spirituality, since real involvement would require the complete elimination of ego, and actually the last thing we want to do is to give up the ego completely.\u201d\n\nThe whole tricky thing about the quest for enlightenment is realizing that questing, striving, is itself evidence of one\u2019s ignorance.

Yet it\u2019s now conducting a highly publicized military operation, destroying Hezbollah attack tunnels snaking under its border with Lebanon. Why?\n\nTrue, tunnels are a major threat, but what worries Israelis even more is Hezbollah\u2019s ever-growing missile arsenal. The Shiite terror group\u2019s patrons in Tehran are busy modernizing those missiles while building indigenous rocket-manufacturing factories on Lebanese territory.\n\nSo why the tunnels first?\n\nTwo such tunnels have been eliminated since the Israeli Defense Forces launched operation Northern Shield last week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the work will last as long as it takes to destroy all tunnels. Maybe months.\n\nThey\u2019re dug deep under the rocky terrain of the border region. Some are reportedly wide enough to transport tanks and other heavy military equipment. IDF briefers say one tunnel, destroyed last week, would have allowed terrorists to seize a major Israeli highway, cutting off Metula and other northern Galilee towns and, presumably, slaughtering residents.\n\nIsrael\u2019s known about the tunneling activity for months. Galilee residents have complained about underground noises at night, and intelligence officials have reportedly used Lebanese sources to map tunneling and follow the digging process. Hezbollah has seized several southern Lebanese villages, taking over residential homes and using the locals as human shields against possible air attack. The terror outfit was apparently unaware of the wealth of intelligence Israel has gathered.\n\nThose details, and others, emerged from press briefings the IDF has conducted regularly during Northern Shield. Netanyahu, similarly, took foreign ambassadors to the border for a detailed presentation. And on Sunday the IDF Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, hosted the commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Stefano Del Col of Italy, at his Tel Aviv headquarters.\n\nThe south Lebanon-based UNIFIL, charged with overseeing the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, has to date mentioned no tunneling activity in its periodic reports to the Security Council. Now Del Col readily admits the Hezbollah tunnels are a serious violation of the ceasefire terms.\n\nAnd as tunnel destruction is conducted entirely inside Israel\u2019s territory (though officials darkly hint they may at one point need to enter the other side of the border), even the toughest critics \u2014 including the UN \u2014 can\u2019t blame Jerusalem for defending itself.\n\nBut if so, again: Why the publicity blitz? Why brief the press, foreign diplomats and the UN?\n\nPart of the answer has to do with Israel\u2019s recognition that in the past it has won decisive military victories while losing the public relations wars. As before, in the next war \u201cHezbollah will hope to survive to fight another day while delegitimizing Israel in the eyes of the world,\u201d says a new report by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.\n\nBut according to JINSA, a think tank comprised of top retired US military officials, the next war will be much bloodier than past skirmishes, as Hezbollah now threatens Israel with up to 140,000 rockets, up from about 10,000 in 2006.\n\nTrue, most of those rockets are primitive, but some Iranian deliveries of high precision missiles through Syria manage to evade IDF air attacks and are now housed in Lebanese villages. Over the weekend Hezbollah\u2019s second in command, Naim Qassem, warned those rockets can reach any point in Israel.\n\nWorse: In September, Netanyahu showed the UN photos of factories being erected near Beirut, where precision missiles are to be manufactured \u2014 bypassing the need to transfer them from Iran. Israel \u201cknows what you\u2019re doing, Israel knows where you are doing it and Israel will not let you get away with it,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nThose factories can be a major game changer, but if the IDF wants to eliminate the threat, it must at first neutralize other menaces \u2014 like tunnels designed to slaughter Israeli civilians in retaliation for an attack on Hezbollah.\n\nAnd destroying those tunnels in full public view, highlighting how Hezbollah takes Lebanese villagers hostage and uses them as human shield, is a bonus in the PR battle \u2014 a major component of modern warfare.", "keywords": ["war", "tunnels", "lebanese", "pr", "win", "idf", "blitz", "military", "israels", "tunneling", "hezbollah", "terror", "border", "hezbollahs", "help", "israel", "major", "netanyahu"], "summary": "Yet it\u2019s now conducting a highly publicized military operation, destroying Hezbollah attack tunnels snaking under its border with Lebanon.\nTrue, tunnels are a major threat, but what worries Israelis even more is Hezbollah\u2019s ever-growing missile arsenal.\nThe Shiite terror group\u2019s patrons in Tehran are busy modernizing those missiles while building indigenous rocket-manufacturing factories on Lebanese territory.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the work will last as long as it takes to destroy all tunnels.\nNow Del Col readily admits the Hezbollah tunnels are a serious violation of the ceasefire terms."}, {"link": "https://www.npr.org/2018/12/10/675210421/its-human-rights-day-however-its-not-universally-accepted", "published": "2018-12-10T10:05:00", "title": "Boundlessly Idealistic, Universal Declaration Of Human Rights Is Still Resisted", "author": ["Tom Gjelten", "Eleanor Roosevelt", "Robert George"], "text": "Boundlessly Idealistic, Universal Declaration Of Human Rights Is Still Resisted\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fotosearch/Getty Images Fotosearch/Getty Images\n\nGiven the rivalries and violence that divide the global community today, it is hard to imagine that on December 10, 1948, the nations of the world approved, almost unanimously, a detailed list of fundamental rights that every human on the planet should enjoy.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the most sweeping such statement ever endorsed on a worldwide basis, opened by asserting, \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\" It proceeded with 30 articles summarizing the things to which everyone would be entitled in a world of genuine peace and justice.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of two horrifying world wars, not a single member state of the newly created United Nations dared oppose the Declaration, though several abstained on the final vote.

Articles calling for equal pay for equal work and universal health care were among those on which the United States itself still falls short.\n\nThe document was largely the work of Eleanor Roosevelt, in her role as chair of the U.N. commission responsible for writing it. The creation of an organization that would unite the nations of the world had been a dream of her late husband, President Franklin Roosevelt, and she saw the elaboration of an international bill of rights as crucial to that work.\n\nWe stand on the threshold of a great event, both in the life of the United Nations and of mankind.\n\n\"We stand on the threshold of a great event, both in the life of the United Nations and of mankind,\" she said in an address to a U.N. General Assembly meeting in Paris on December 9. The proposed declaration, she said, would serve \"as a common standard of achievement for all peoples of all nations.\" Its passage the next day by a vote of 48 to 0, with eight abstentions, brought a standing ovation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Green/AP Green/AP\n\nThe most ambitious feature of the Declaration was its claim to be applicable across all cultures, political systems, and religious traditions throughout the world. It was a thoroughly secular product, written without religious references and adopted by governments in the name of man, not God.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Declaration stirred some controversy at the time, despite its adoption without overt opposition, and resistance to its sweep has only increased in the last seven decades.\n\nAmong the eight countries that abstained on the final vote were the Soviet Union and the five Soviet bloc states that were U.N. members at the time. South Africa, whose apartheid regime could not stomach any declaration condemning racial discrimination, also abstained. So did Saudi Arabia, claiming some rights listed in the Declaration were not consistent with Islamic law.\n\nSome U.S. conservatives made clear their own unease with the Declaration, seeing its assertion of broad economic rights as a step toward socialism. The Soviets had the opposite objection to the Declaration, arguing that it favored individual over collective rights and undermined national sovereignty.\n\nA western construct?\n\nTo be sure, the Declaration was rooted intellectually in western thought. In promoting the draft document, Eleanor Roosevelt likened it to the Magna Carta, the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. The United Nations at the time, in fact, was still dominated by western interests. Africa remained largely under colonial rule, and British rule in South Asia had barely ended.\n\nIn later years, lawyers who brought up the Universal Declaration or related international covenants in their advocacy for human rights sometimes found themselves on the defensive in non-western countries.\n\n\"At the beginning of my career, there was much resistance to my work abroad,\" says Asma Uddin, a human rights lawyer and senior scholar at the Freedom Forum Institute's Religious Freedom Center. \"The common discourse I heard was that I was somehow an agent for western colonialism.\"\n\nOn its anniversary, however, the Universal Declaration is getting a robust defense.\n\n\"The idea that [the Declaration] is some western construct that is unjustly imposed on the rest of the world ... is idiotic,\" says Robert George, a professor of jurisprudence at Princeton University and former chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.\n\n\"The Declaration sets forth at the very beginning that the foundation of all of our rights is the profound and equal dignity of each and every member of the human family,\" George argues. \"It is not the gift of kings or potentates or presidents or parliaments, but one that is inherent.\"\n\nIt is not the gift of kings or potentates or presidents or parliaments, but one that is inherent.\n\nThe most significant objections to the Declaration have been in the Islamic world and focus mainly on the articles concerning marriage, family, and religious freedom. Saudi Arabia's decision in 1948 to abstain from the final vote on the Universal Declaration stemmed primarily from its disagreement with the Declaration's affirmation of a right to change religion, a move some Islamic scholars view as apostasy. Similarly, some Muslims insist that freedom of expression cannot be taken so far as to justify insulting the Prophet Mohammed, which may be considered blasphemy.\n\nIn 1990, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, comprising more than 50 Muslim-majority states, answered the Universal Declaration with a version of its own, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam. The Cairo Declaration affirmed Islamic law (sharia) as its sole source and notably omitted any reference to a right to change religion.\n\nRecent years, however, have brought new efforts to reconcile Islam with the Universal Declaration and other international human rights instruments. Scholars in Pakistan have mounted a challenge to anti-blasphemy laws through the organization Engage Pakistan, arguing that the blasphemy punishments being imposed are not genuinely rooted in Islamic scripture.\n\n\"The work is as fundamental as just going back to the traditional Islamic texts that were cited [as supporting] punishments for blasphemy, and saying, 'Hey, if you go back to the text, it actually says something quite different,'\" says Asma Uddin, herself a Muslim from a Pakistani family. \"Whether it's scholars or activists, they're coming from a traditional perspective. It's not some sort of progressive or reform interpretation of Islam. It's going straight to the classical sources and finding evidence there.\"\n\nOn that point, Princeton's Robert George is in full agreement.\n\n\"It is a defamation of Islam to suppose that it cannot embrace a concept of human dignity like we have in the [Universal] Declaration, or that it must reject the core rights articulated in the text,\" George says. \"I would say the same is true of the great traditions of Buddhism, of Hinduism, of Taoism, of Confucianism, and so forth.\"\n\nThe struggle to promote any worldwide human rights agreement these days, however, must deal with growing nationalism in many countries and the notion that anything smacking of \"globalism\" is suspect. Identity politics in many cases draws strength from ethnic or religious conflict.\n\n\"Those are the lines that these political actors are trying to draw,\" says Uddin. \"By conceding that maybe there isn't a basis for conflict, it weakens them.\"", "keywords": ["universal", "boundlessly", "resisted", "nations", "religious", "human", "world", "declaration", "islamic", "western", "rights", "united", "idealistic"], "summary": "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the most sweeping such statement ever endorsed on a worldwide basis, opened by asserting, \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\"\nIn later years, lawyers who brought up the Universal Declaration or related international covenants in their advocacy for human rights sometimes found themselves on the defensive in non-western countries.\nOn its anniversary, however, the Universal Declaration is getting a robust defense.\nIn 1990, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, comprising more than 50 Muslim-majority states, answered the Universal Declaration with a version of its own, the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam.\nRecent years, however, have brought new efforts to reconcile Islam with the Universal Declaration and other international human rights instruments."}, {"link": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6480367/Victoria-Sweden-attends-Nobel-Peace-Prize-ceremony.html", "published": "2018-12-10T17:36:00", "title": "Victoria of Sweden attends the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony", "author": ["Kerry Mcdermott For Mailonline"], "text": "Advertisement\n\nSweden's Victoria looked every inch the princess at the Nobel Prize ceremony on Monday evening.\n\nThe Crown Princess, 41, wore a spectacular tiara with her ballgown and ceremonial sash at the event in Stockholm, which was also attended by her brother Prince Carl-Philip and his wife, Princess Sofia, 34.\n\nSofia too pulled out all the stops, choosing a floor-length red gown for the ceremony, set off by a pearl choker and a dazzling tiara of her own.\n\nThe future queen Victoria was seen joining in with the Swedish national anthem ahead of the ceremony, held at the Concert Hall in Stockholm on Monday.\n\nSweden's Crown Princess Victoria wore a pink and grey ballgown, along with a ceremonial sash, and a spectacular tiara for the ceremony in Stockholm -

About half the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods you\u2019ve already put tariffs on come almost exclusively from China, which means American consumers are taking a hit this holiday season.\n\nThese tariffs function exactly like taxes.

The middle class and poor pay a larger percentage of their incomes on these tariffs than do the rich.\n\nI needn\u2019t remind you that your Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed last year, slashed taxes on big corporations and the rich by about $150 billion annually. You claimed it would cause companies to invest more in America and thereby create more American jobs. They didn\u2019t. (See General Motors.)\n\nThey spent most of their tax savings buying back their own shares of stock. This gave the stock market a steroidal boost. Not surprisingly, the boost was temporary. Last week the stock market erased all its gains for 2018. Worse may be in store. The whole American economy is slowing.\n\nYour tariffs could put us into a recession. The world\u2019s other big economies are slowing, too. In 1930, Congressmen Smoot and Hawley championed isolationist tariffs that Herbert Hoover signed into law. They deepened the Great Depression.\n\nYour economic advisors are trying to put the best possible face on all this, arguing that your tariffs are designed to improve your bargaining leverage with China.\n\nBut your recent U.S.-China trade deal is already unraveling. More accurately, the deal never happened. Your claims about Beijing agreeing to buy more U.S. agriculture and natural gas weren\u2019t backed up by your own administration or the Chinese government. Sort of like your \u201cgreat\u201d deal with Kim Jung Un.\n\nSome of your advisors say your real aim isn\u2019t about trade at all. It\u2019s to get China to stop stealing American technology. This presumably was the reason behind last week\u2019s arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technology. (Hint: That arrest won\u2019t make it any easier to reach an agreement with China.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so interested in helping American corporations protect their technology, anyway. That technology doesn\u2019t belong to the United States. It belongs to those corporations and their shareholders. They develop and share it all over the world.\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nMost of these corporations have been willing to share their technology with China in joint ventures with Chinese companies, because that\u2019s the price of entering the lucrative Chinese market. They still come away making lots of money.\n\nOf course, they could make even more if the Chinese didn\u2019t take the technology. So maybe, as with the tax cut, you just want to make big corporations richer.\n\nBut let me give you the benefit of the doubt. I\u2019m going to assume your real concern is America\u2019s national security, and that this whole \u201ctariff man\u201d blunderbuss is designed to prevent China from racing ahead of us in technologies that are critical to national defense.\n\nJohn Bolton, your National Security Adviser, has said the real issue is \u201ca question of power,\u201d and the theft of intellectual property has \u201ca major impact on China\u2019s economic capacity and therefore on its military capacity.\u201d Bolton advises you, right?\n\nBut if this is your real motive\u2014and, quite frankly, I can\u2019t come up with another reasonable one\u2014might I suggest a better way to protect national security?\n\nYou have the authority to stop foreign corporations from buying any American corporation whose technology is critical to national security. So why not prohibit American corporations that possess such critical technology from sharing it with China, even if that\u2019s the price of gaining access to China\u2019s lucrative market?\n\nBar them from entering into joint ventures with Chinese corporations, prevent them from teaming up with Chinese state-owned companies, and demand that they guard their technology, under penalty of law.\n\nSure, these America corporations would have to sacrifice some profits, but so what? Your job isn\u2019t to make them more profitable. It\u2019s to protect the United States. And isn\u2019t this is a better way to do so than to impose a hugely regressive tax on average Americans and risk a global recession?\n\nRead more: Robert Reich\u2014Trump is violating the three basic principles of the rule of law | Opinion\n\nRobert Reich is the chancellor\u2019s professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a senior fellow at the Blum Center for Developing Economies.

Two soldiers manning a Turkish Cypriot guard post checked the driver's ID, then waved the van through to the buffer zone that divides the northern part of the Mediterranean island from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, a European Union member.\n\nSaleh, who said he fled religious fundamentalism in Iraq, is one of the thousands of migrants who have slipped into Cyprus this year across its porous 180-kilometer-long (120-mile-long) buffer zone. Migrant arrivals by sea have also increased, turning tiny Cyprus into the EU's top recipient of asylum-seekers relative to its population size, as other EU countries have tightened their borders.\n\nGovernment statistics show that about 5,000 people \u2014 mostly from Syria but also Somalia, Pakistan, India, Iraq, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cameroon \u2014 had claimed asylum in Cyprus by the end of August. That's expected to reach 8,000 by year's end, up from 3,000 in 2016. While that's a fraction of the hundreds of thousands seeking asylum in the EU, it's putting pressure on a country with just over 1 million people.\n\n\"We're trying to cope, but for a long time, now, we have exceeded our fair share,\" Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides told The Associated Press.\n\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Authorities in the north aren't recognized by the international community except for Turkey, which itself doesn't recognize the Cypriot government in the Greek-speaking south.\n\nDespite its proximity to the conflict zones of the Middle East, Cyprus received relatively few asylum-seekers during the peak of Europe's migrant crisis three years ago, when most migrants arrived in Greece and made their way through the Balkans toward countries in northern Europe. An island nation just emerging from a severe economic crisis, Cyprus wasn't seen as an attractive destination for migrants and refugees seeking shelter and a new life in Europe.\n\nBut that changed as nations in Europe shut their borders and the economic situation improved.\n\nPetrides said Cypriot authorities know about at least one trafficking ring using the breakaway north as a conduit for migrants from Syria via Turkey, from where they either catch commercial flights or boats to the island. Government officials say nearly half of the recent migrant arrivals have entered Cyprus that way.\n\nOthers arrive directly in southern Cyprus on rickety smuggling vessels from Turkey or Lebanon, which has taken in about 1 million Syrian refugees.\n\nSaleh flew from Irbil in northern Iraq to Turkey's capital, Ankara, where he caught a connecting flight to Ercan airport in Cyprus' breakaway north. In most cases, Turkish Cypriot authorities don't require advance visas for passengers arriving from Turkey.\n\nSaleh is now staying at a center in a village south of Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, where he awaits a decision on his asylum claim.\n\nCorina Drousiotou, who heads the Cyprus Refugee Council, a nonprofit group, said there's now a backlog of 8,000 asylum applications and it takes three to five years to process a claim, including appeals.\n\nThe EU head office in Brussels told the AP its European Asylum Support office is deploying 29 case workers plus interpreters to help Cyprus clear the backlog, and has given Cyprus almost 40 million euros for migration management in the 2014-2020 period.\n\nDrousiotou said the situation is \"manageable\" as long as Cyprus taps into support from fellow EU members and other international agencies. She said there's plenty of demand for workers by employers on the island's booming tourism sector. But authorities need to urgently find more housing for migrants as cases of homelessness \u2014 previously rare in Cyprus \u2014 have now cropped up. She said monthly allowances to asylum-seekers of around $400 (350 euros) also need to be raised.\n\nPetrides, the interior minister, said Cyprus has sought additional funding from the EU to upgrade migrant centers, process asylum applications and monitor the border better. He said Cyprus is also trying to establish a fast-track asylum procedure and set up dedicated courts to hear the appeals of unsuccessful asylum applicants.\n\nSaleh said he's hoping to find a job as soon as he finds out whether he can stay in Cyprus. He has no \"Plan B.\"\n\n\"I can't go back to my country,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nKarl Ritter in Rome contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["eu", "sees", "cyprus", "turkey", "crossing", "surge", "iraq", "breakaway", "migrants", "north", "cypriot", "authorities", "turkish", "migrant", "asylum"], "summary": "\"You don't know me, I don't know you,\" the 32-year-old Saleh said he was told by the trafficker before he climbed into a van on the Turkish Cypriot side.\nCyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with Greece.\nSaleh flew from Irbil in northern Iraq to Turkey's capital, Ankara, where he caught a connecting flight to Ercan airport in Cyprus' breakaway north.\nIn most cases, Turkish Cypriot authorities don't require advance visas for passengers arriving from Turkey.\nBut authorities need to urgently find more housing for migrants as cases of homelessness \u2014 previously rare in Cyprus \u2014 have now cropped up."}, {"link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-tusk/eu-rules-out-reworking-brexit-deal-prepares-for-no-deal-tusk-idUSKBN1O926F", "published": "2018-12-10T18:27:00", "title": "EU rules out reworking Brexit deal, prepares for no-deal: Tusk", "author": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "text": "FILE PHOTO: European Council President Donald Tusk attends a news conference after the extraordinary EU leaders summit to finalise and formalise the Brexit agreement in Brussels, Belgium November 25, 2018.

Advances in scientific modeling and additional climbs in temperatures are making the connection between global warming and extreme weather much more concrete.\n\n\"Global temperature, the backdrop in which extremes are unfolding, continues to rise. ... Nature is thereby increasingly rolling back its curtain of sensitivity to rising greenhouse gases,\" Martin Hoerling, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of Monday's report, wrote in an email.\n\n\"This alone is making it easier to scientifically identify the fingerprint of human influence, not to mention improved modeling tools,\" Hoerling said.\n\nPeople walk through the flooded streets of Houston on August 27, 2017, after Hurricane Harvey dumped record rains.\n\nScientists found that record warm waters in the Tasman Sea in 2017 and 2018 \"were virtually impossible without global warming,\" and they concluded that a crippling drought in East Africa that has led to food shortages for millions of people would not have occurred naturally before the Industrial Revolution, when humans began to interfere with the climate system.\n\nDocumentation of the Great Barrier Reef near Port Douglas from Greenpeace Australia Pacific shows damage to coral from above-average temperatures.\n\nIncluded in the 17 events identified in the report in which global warming played a role were major floods such as those with Hurricane Harvey, fires, heat waves over land and in the ocean, and even record low sunshine in Japan in August 2017.\n\nThe findings are part of an annual report titled \"Explaining Extreme Events in 2017 from a Climate Perspective,\" which reveals clear ties between recent extremes in weather and human influences of the climate.\n\n\"This is about understanding that climate is already changing the risks of extremes,\" said Jeff Rosenfeld, editor in chief of the Bulletin of the AMS, the journal in which the report was published.\n\nThe report features the research of 120 scientists from 10 countries and examines a wide array of extreme weather and events from 2017. The scientists looked at how these events compare with historical observations as well as model simulations to determine whether there was influence from climate change.\n\nThese type of comparisons, known as attribution studies, attempt to quantify humans' role in making certain events more likely, or more extreme, through warming the planet.\n\n\"Attribution science has given everyone a rational, quantifiable way to talk about human-caused climate change as it manifests itself to people,\" Rosenfeld said, \"not as a technical number, a global trend, but as a concrete force in the risks we all face.\"\n\nNew in this year's report: perspective essays written by managers and planners in various sectors of society to show the importance the attribution studies and how they can help prepare for and navigate extreme events.\n\nFor example, during Harvey, water managers in Texas and Louisiana were challenged with rainfall forecasts far beyond anything ever observed, and according to Julie Vano, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research who was involved in the report, the managers struggled to believe that much rainfall would actually fall.\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Downtown Houston is reflected in the flooded Buffalo Bayou on Wednesday, August 30, five days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas.

Heat waves like the one in southern Europe and the Mediterranean in 2017, dubbed \"Lucifer\" in the media , are now three times more likely than they were in 1950the report says.\n\nAnd though it wasn't included in this year's report because it happened too recently, extreme drought and heat wave this year in Europe saw temperatures climb above 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit) all the way to the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and unprecedented drought in north and central Europe.\n\nHurricane Harvey's rainfall, which totaled over 60 inches over the course of four days in late August 2017, was worsened by a warmer climate providing warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures and more moisture in the air, a fact backed up by multiple studies, the report says.\n\nNot all of the impacts from these climate extremes are direct.\n\nE\n\nxtremely warm sea surface temperatures off the coast of Africa doubled the probability of drought in East Africa, leaving more than 6 million people in Somalia facing food shortages. The analysis in the new report found that such extreme ocean heat would not have occurred in a pre-industrial climate, before human carbon emissions.", "keywords": ["houston", "74", "caption", "causing", "change", "harvey", "hurricane", "slams", "climate", "texas", "weather", "photos", "hide", "extreme", "flooded"], "summary": "Hide Caption 3 of 74 Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Floodwaters engulf homes in Port Arthur on August 30.\nHide Caption 4 of 74 Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Janice Forse cries at an emergency shelter in Beaumont on August 30.\nHide Caption 16 of 74 Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Volunteers organize items donated for Hurricane Harvey victims in Dallas on August 29.\nHide Caption 32 of 74 Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas Bridget Brundrett presents an American flag to Texas Gov.\nHide Caption 59 of 74 Photos: Hurricane Harvey slams Texas A graveyard is flooded in Pearland, Texas, on August 27."}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html", "published": "2018-12-11T03:28:17", "title": "Targets of U.S. Sanctions Hire Lobbyists With Trump Ties to Seek Relief", "author": ["Kenneth P.

The suits say the Australian government is also guilty of intentional infliction of harm in the use of an offshore processing system, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe suits were filed by the National Justice Project, a human rights group based in Australia, and represent about 1,200 migrants detained in camps on the independent island of Nauru and on Manus, Papua New Guinea. Researchers and activists say many of them fled from places such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Myanmar and even Bangladesh seeking asylum.\n\nThe suits accuse the Australian government of breaking international law and abrogating its \"duty of care\" for asylum seekers, reports The New York Times. The team representing the migrants is seeking injunctions to transfer the asylum seekers to safety in Australia and award damages, arguing that they have been subject to arbitrary imprisonment and severe deprivation of physical liberty; denial of proper medical assessments and treatment; inadequate security and protection; inadequate food and water; inadequate accommodation; and an unhygienic environment, the Times reports.\n\nFor several years, The Guardian reports, there have been serious allegations and incidents on Manus and Nauru of \"officials denying, delaying or blocking the transfers of people who doctors said required urgent medical care.\"\n\nThe National Justice Project said the Australian government was continuing to treat its clients in this manner \"in order to deter other people from trying to get to Australia by boat in order to seek asylum,\" according to The Guardian.\n\nIn October, aid group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said the mental health situation of refugees on Nauru is \"beyond desperate,\" and called \"for the immediate evacuation of all asylum seekers and refugees from the island and for an end to the Australian offshore detention policy.\"\n\nThe New York Times reports, \"In documents submitted to the court, detainees describe conditions on the islands that include 'high levels of self-harm, including self-cutting, lip sewing, swallowing rocks, burning with cigarettes' and 'refraining from eating and drinking.' \"\n\nAustralia's Department of Home Affairs has not replied to a request seeking comment on the lawsuits. In September 2016, NPR's Steve Inskeep spoke with Australia's then-immigration minister, Peter Dutton, about the country's policy toward people trying to arrive by boat without proper permission. Dutton said settlement of refugees such as those on Manus and Nauru might result in an uncontrollable influx of migrants to Australia in the future.\n\n\"The fear is that the 50,000 would come again on 800 boats and we would have 1,200 people drowning at sea. The image that people saw on the television screens of the little boy who died in the waters of the Mediterranean - that played out 1,200 times,\" Dutton said.\n\nIn June 2017, NPR reported the Australian government agreed to a $70 million ($53 million U.S.) settlement with 1,905 people who were held at a refugee detention camp on Manus Island. In that lawsuit, detainees accused the Australian government of negligence and false imprisonment.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries were to be granted asylum in the U.S. \"The Obama administration agreed to take 1,250 refugees from Manus and other offshore facilities,\" NPR reported. \"The Trump administration has agreed to uphold the agreement, though President Trump has called it a 'dumb deal.' \"\n\nIn the past Australia's Department of Home Affairs has refuted claims of dangerous conditions for people in off-shore detention centers.\n\nEarlier this year, in response to a Refugee Council of Australia's report on the processing of refugees in Nauru, the department wrote:\n\n\"The Department takes the health and safety of refugees and transferees in Nauru very seriously and welcomes independent scrutiny of Australia's support of regional processing arrangements. ...

The proposed legislation, which Kushner said was \"very close\" to becoming law, would reduce mandatory prison terms for certain drug crimes and give judges in some cases more discretion on punishments.\n\nIt additionally would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack-cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for reduced penalties, and would include provisions to encourage education and workforce training in prisons. Roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\n\"This bill will accomplish a lot to make our communities safer,\" Kushner said. \"The recidivism rate that we have is way too high, and not doing anything about that is irresponsible. And we\u2019re allowing people to go back to our communities who we can help, and there\u2019s a lot of programs based in red states that we\u2019ve really modeled this off of, so we know that this works.\n\n\n\n\"And, we\u2019ve been able to build a very strong bipartisan coalition under the president\u2019s leadership. They\u2019ve come up with a bill that we think can really solve a lot of those problems. And what it is, is going into the prisons and giving job training, vocational training, mentorship... mental health treatment, drug addiction treatment to people who are coming out, who are nonviolent offenders and figuring out how when they leave prison they have a better chance of getting a job and re-entering society in a productive manner than going back to a life of crime,\" Kushner continued.\n\nHe added that Democrats and Republicans were \"very close\" to voting on and passing the bill, and that \"hopefully this will get to the floor and we\u2019ll be able to have a big bipartisan celebration.\"\n\nThe bill \"ranks all the different inmates who are in our federal prison system under a likelihood of committing a crime in the future, and it allows us to put the focus on the nonviolent people who have a low risk,\" Kushner said. \"Like somebody like Alice Marie Johnson; that case was a grave misjustice and -- and the president did a great job towards righting that wrong, that that case really touched his heart and now is something where he realized that there was no reason for taxpayers to be paying to house somebody like Alice, when she can be out in society, being a good role model for others and taking the mistakes that she made and figuring out how to show other people not to make those same mistakes.\"\n\nTRUMP COMMUTES SENTENCE OF ALICE JOHNSON, WOMAN SERVING LIFE-TERM FOR DRUG OFFENSES, AFTER MEETING WITH KARDASHIAN\n\nKushner insisted that day-to-day White House operations aren't affected by what he called media \"noise,\" and pointed to the news that the U.S. this week became a net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years.\n\n\"Nobody really saw a lot of these numbers coming, in terms of the oil exports and how we were going to make America an energy-independent country, but we\u2019ve accomplished that, and that\u2019s been through a lot of great work of a lot of the Cabinet secretaries, but really the leadership of the president, to make that happen,\" he said.\n\nAfter thanking outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly for his \"great service this administration,\" Kushner discussed the various personnel shake-ups in the Trump administration.\n\n\"We just brought in a new White House Counsel today who just started, who is going to be fabulous,\" Kushner said, referring to Pat Cipollone, who is taking over as the Trump administration's top lawyer as multiple reports and indications suggest Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe is winding down.\n\nCipollone, replacing outgoing White House Counsel Don McGahn, also will oversee the president's federal judicial nominees and ethics investigations into the administration -- including a possible probe by House Democrats into the use of a private email service by both Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump.\n\nKushner additionally praised Trump's nomination of prominent lawyer William Barr to become attorney general again. Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W.

He had fled their mountaintop community here in rural Honduras without a phone because no one in the family could afford one. Their floor was made of dirt, they grew their own food. Watching coverage of the migrant caravan heading for the United States was Hern\u00e1ndez's only way to know if he was alive.\n\nWhat she saw in the broadcasts were visions from hell. Families jumping from bridges, getting kidnapped along dusty roads, dodging tear gas cannons fired by police from richer nations. How could this be? She continued scanning, hoping to find him, hoping not to.\n\nShe had begged Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez not to go, but her 30-year-old husband had his reasons. The town's corn and bean crops had failed during a years-long drought. There was no work aside from farming. No money for irrigation. Their four children, ages 3 to 13, had little to eat.\n\nRam\u00edrez told his wife that he had no choice but to leave with the \"caravan\" of thousands that had formed in Honduras and would make its way north. This was their chance, she recalled him saying that day. He could go with the group, find work, send back money.\n\nIt was this or risk starvation.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez with her four children.\n\nThe couple's tragic story, as well as others I heard on a recent four-day trip to western Honduras, complicates two narratives being told about the migrant caravan.\n\nTo hear President Trump tell it, Central American \"Gang Members and some very bad people\" are attempting to storm the United States at its southern border. \"This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you,\" the President wrote on Twitter. American news reports, meanwhile, largely have focused on high rates of violent crime in Honduras and El Salvador that have driven families to seek asylum as refugees in the United States.\n\nOverlooked is this factor: climate change.\n\nThe \"dry corridor\" of Central America, which includes parts of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, has been hit with an unusual drought for the last five years. Crops are failing. Starvation is lurking. More than two million people in the region are at risk for hunger, according to an August report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, without any change in rain patterns, people are already struggling,\" said Edwin Castellanos, dean of research at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and a global authority on climate change in Central America. \"In some of these dry areas, we have seen events of children actually dying out of hunger. So, it is that extreme.\"\n\nThis drought has been longer and more intense than those seen before in the dry corridor, Castellanos said. The failure of critical springtime rains is also new, he said, and is causing such problems for farmers whose crops depend on that water.\n\nSubsistence crops like corn and beans are all but dying. Our crew saw beans the size of Tic Tacs. And shriveled, partially blackened ears of corn could fit inside your palm.\n\nCorn crops have been smaller than usual, leading to a hunger crisis.\n\nKevin McAleenan, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said in a speech on Friday that drought and crop failures in Honduras and Guatemala \"directly translate into who's arriving at our border.\"\n\nStudies have not definitively tied this particular drought to climate change, but computer models show droughts like the one happening now are becoming more common as the world warms.\n\nThousands have risked their lives to flee these circumstances.\n\nAnd previously unpublished data shows people started leaving certain areas of Honduras amid crop failures -- even as homicide rates were declining.\n\nTake Cop\u00e1n, the region of Honduras that Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez fled in October.\n\nIn fiscal year 2012, around the start of the drought, only about 20 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by the US Border Patrol while trying to cross the US-Mexico border, according to a data analysis of records shared with CNN by Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at The University of Texas at Austin. Then drought hit, its cumulative effects growing as the years wore on. In 2017, about 1,450 family members from Cop\u00e1n were apprehended by US authorities at the border, the data show. In fiscal year 2018, with the data ending in September, the number of migrants picked up was more than 2,500.\n\nThose figures are \"absolutely\" an underestimation, said Leutert. \"You're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to big cities, you're missing people who left Cop\u00e1n and went to another place in the region, you're missing people who tried to go to the United States and didn't make it -- and you're missing people who went to the United States and crossed undetected.\"\n\nThe figure is a \"baseline\" that shows something big is happening, she said.\n\nAny person's decision to abandon their homeland is complex. For some, violence is part of it. As is extreme poverty. In Central America, it's often a combination of things.\n\nBut there's another truth: This region is becoming less hospitable to farmers as more-industrialized countries burn loads of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. A December report shows the world is on track to create 37.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2018 -- yet another record. This pollution traps heat and warms the planet, making cyclical weather events like droughts, floods and certain storms worse.\n\nThe United States, which is the destination for so many migrants fleeing Honduras, bears outsize responsibility for global warming. Cumulatively, the nation has done more to cause climate change since the Industrial Revolution than any other. Today, President Trump supports increased coal production and has pledged to abandon the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to at most 2 degrees Celsius. A \"rulebook\" for that agreement is being debated this week at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, with the United States on the sidelines.\n\nNotably, Trump also has also made immigration his signature issues, rallying supporters around the idea of stopping people from Latin America, like Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, from crossing illegally into the United States. There's broad support for a crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States among Republican voters. A quarter of US midterm voters said that immigration was their No. 1 issue, and 75% of those voters were Republicans, according to a November exit poll. \"Build that wall\" has become a popular chant at Trump political rallies.\n\nFederal authorities have met would-be migrants at the border near San Diego with tear gas. Officials say the tear-gassing occurred after migrants threw rocks at authorities.\n\nYet there's an unspoken irony here.\n\nThe nation that's become a destination for so many migrants -- a beacon of opportunity and hope --is contributing to the conditions forcing some people to abandon home.\n\n'I was waiting for you like the rains in May'\n\nThink of Central America like an island.\n\nThat's advice from Castellanos, the climate scientist in Guatemala.\n\nHe's not talking about just any old island. He's referencing the specks of land in the Pacific -- Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands -- whose very existence is threatened by rising sea levels that are linked to global warming. I visited the Marshall Islands in 2015 after readers of CNN's \"Two Degrees\" series voted for me to do a story on \"climate refugees.\" Higher tides and increased flooding were already pushing people out -- and to Arkansas, of all places.\n\nCrops have been failing in the \"dry corridor\" of Central America.\n\nThese little islands gained a huge voice at the United Nations climate talks in Paris in December of that year -- the predecessor to the talks happening now in Poland. Calling themselves the \"High Ambition Coalition,\" island diplomats rallied with richer nations to make a moral case for climate action -- saying their sovereign territory would vanish if global temperatures were allowed to warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. That goal became embedded in the Paris Agreement. In order to achieve it, global carbon emissions would need to be cut in half in about a decade.\n\nThe climate problem in Central America isn't so much sea-level rise. But Castellanos told me an argument can be made that the region is nearly as susceptible to global warming. It is a slim stretch of land connecting North and South America -- a string of land between continents. That makes it vulnerable to storms coming from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean. Climate change is supercharging those. Plus, climate models show both floods and droughts getting more intense. The United Nations Development Programme considers Honduras to be \"highly vulnerable\" to climate change, both now and in the future as the atmosphere continues to warm.\n\nThe dry corridor gets that name because it's long been dry, situated behind a mountain range that catches weather from the Caribbean. But the recent drought there has challenged notions about how bad a drought in Central America could be, Castellanos told me. Some areas have seen 10 consecutive months without rain.\n\nCentral Americans have an expression -- \"I was waiting for you like the rains in May.\" It references the fact that massive rains fall in May and June, like clockwork each year. Farmers plant their crops accordingly, counting on the spring rains to soak the plants and ensure a productive harvest. Many people here are subsistence farmers and can't afford irrigation systems. They're completely at the mercy of rains, and those rains aren't coming.\n\nWhen they do come, they come all at once -- causing floods and damage.\n\n\"Here, unlike in the United States, we don't have a problem of convincing people\" that climate change is real, Castellanos told me. \"People are convinced by what they see.\"\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, the farmer on the hilltop in Cop\u00e1n, lived through this. Then he heard the caravan was passing near his village. People believed that traveling together would provide safety. From Honduras to Guatemala to Mexico, the number would grow into the thousands.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ramirez left with the migrant \"caravan\" in October.\n\nIn mid-October, Ram\u00edrez fled Cop\u00e1n on foot, hoping to catch the caravan. He carried a small backpack with a few items of clothing, his wife said. In his pocket was a paper with a neighbor's telephone number on it.\n\nThat phone would ring in the village some time later.\n\nIt would not be Ram\u00edrez's voice on the phone.\n\nAnd the news would not be good.\n\n'We are losing most of the crops'\n\nI came to meet the people left behind.\n\nThe location: several communities in the Cop\u00e1n Department of Honduras, near the Guatemala border. I'd chosen the place because of the data CNN analyzed with Stephanie Leutert, from the University of Texas.\n\nThe data, which tracks families apprehended at the US-Mexico border, does not prove on its own that people are fleeing Cop\u00e1n because of climate change. But the figures do support the idea that people newly started fleeing during that timeframe.\n\nThe first point is that the exodus from Cop\u00e1n has grown faster than in the rest of Honduras. In 2012, only 3.7% of Honduran migrants came from that area. By 2018, up to September, it was more than 9%.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of murders per year in Cop\u00e1n has been declining.\n\nAgain, this provides only a rough sketch of what's happening, Leutert said, but it is clear that climate change is one factor driving people from the region. \"Climate change is reducing (crop) yields,\" she said. \"It's like a tax. It's making things harder for people and industries that rely on weather stability. Sometimes climate change can push people over the edge and make it impossible (to survive). We see that with the coffee industry. That last added cost is making the business model unsustainable -- and pushing people to migrate.\"\n\nCop\u00e1n is a mountainous place of dense forest and sweeping valleys. In the morning, mist rises from the hills like steam, making it look like molten ripples of land have just cooled. By afternoon, clouds hang on the hilltops, threatening to rain but rarely cracking. Dried-up corn stalks, which look almost unrecognizable if you're used to the engineered, Midwestern variety, dart around at odd angles between rocks and patches of dirt, clinging to steep hillsides. The more fertile land is the valleys, where most crops grow. Even during the worst of the drought, some vegetation here is green and appears almost lush. But Castellanos and others told me it's the timing and amount of rain that's critical. And many months here are now totally dry.\n\nWhat was it like to live in this place?\n\nAnd how and when did people feel it was impossible to stay?\n\nThe resident of this house in Copan, Honduras, emigrated. The area has seen its homicide rate go down while emigration to the US rises.\n\nOur team drove south past a town that was abandoned by the Mayan people thousands of years ago and now is known for the remaining artifacts. Our tires kicked up dust from the path, coating every roadside fern in a film of beige.\n\nAt a construction site, Evelio Ochoa, 35, was pouring cement into the land -- helping build the foundation of a home for his niece. He's doing any odd job he can find these days. Years ago, he told me, he paid a coyote -- a smuggler -- to help him leave Honduras. His small plot of corn and bean crops had failed, he said. The coyote's price: 60,000 Lempiras, or about $2,500. He got the money from a relative, he said.\n\nThat price bought him three attempts to reach the United States.\n\nHe made the first attempt in 2014, he told me, amid record drought.\n\nThe second was earlier this year.\n\nBoth times he was deported, he said.\n\nIf he failed a third time, there would be no money to try again.\n\n\"You don't fear for yourself, you fear for your family,\" Ochoa said of setting out on the journey. \"The moment you step out of the house and start walking it's difficult -- not because of the danger but because you miss your family\" and are thinking about their safety.\n\nIn September, Ochoa said, authorities caught him a third time.\n\nHe finds himself back in Honduras, struggling to feed his family.\n\nEvelio Ochoa said he fled to the United States three times unsuccessfully.\n\nOchoa's wife, Nora Vazques, said she and their five children would have starved if a relative hadn't been sending money from the United States. The 33-year-old mother, whose children are ages 1 to 12, showed me a basket of unusable black corn kernels, picked from a rotten crop.\n\n\"Before, the rain was much better,\" she said standing in the shadow of her doorway, the midday light half-illuminating her face. Her hand shook as she wiped away tears.\n\n\"He grew a lot of corn\" back then, she said. \"Now we are losing most of the crops.\"\n\n'This is an injustice'\n\nLisandro Mauricio Arias is mayor of the town the Mayans abandoned.\n\nWe met at the town square, which is surrounded by tile roofs and palm trees. Cop\u00e1n Ruinas is a tourist destination that boasts several quaint hotels, but the town has seen better times. For that reason, I figured Arias might downplay the outmigration that data shows is occurring here -- that he might have an incentive to say the drought hasn't been so bad.\n\nHe didn't do that.\n\nThe town is emptying out, he told me.\n\nHow many people have left?\n\nHis guess: 30%.\n\nHe regrets that, but says it may be the only way.\n\n\"When analyzing precipitation levels, we can see they have changed a lot -- which is really alarming,\" he said. \"Problems associated with drought will get worse.\"\n\n\"We respect the decisions the United States is making,\" he added. \"It's their country, and they have the right to defend it. However, I believe they need to take into consideration the human factor -- what is humanity? These people are not trying to meddle. [They are] looking for an opportunity to survive.\"\n\nAmong those people are the sons of Mariano and Gregoria Perez.\n\nThe two young men, ages 19 and 26, are stuck in Tijuana, Mexico, according to their family in Honduras. Their parents have only been able to speak with them two or three times, they said, because phone credit is so expensive. (I was unable to reach them.)\n\nTwo of Gregoria Perez's sons left Honduras in the migrant \"caravan.\"\n\nWhat the men's parents know are only the barest of details. One son was mugged and lost all of his belongings, including his passport, according to Mariano Perez, 55. Gregoria said she told the boys they could come back home. Secretly, though, the family worries. The young men have crossed international borders illegally already. Could they come back?\n\n\"I would say that this is an injustice because they did not do anything wrong,\" said Gregoria Perez, who, like her husband, said the boys left because farming wasn't viable amid the drought, and there were no other options. \"They want to find work to sustain themselves.\"\n\nI sat down outside to talk with her husband as the sun was setting. He sat on a small wooden stool and I was on the ground. The angle and time of night rendered his face in silhouette.\n\nMariano Perez told me his sons heard about the caravan on TV and left the same day. The father was down the hill helping a neighbor build a fence. He didn't know they'd left until he returned home that night. He doesn't fault them for it. He knew why they left, of course: drought.\n\nWhat bothers him is where they are now.\n\nHe worries they're hungry in Tijuana, as they were here.\n\nHe worries they may not make it across the border.\n\nSometimes, in his darker moments, he wonders if this is what God predicted in the book of Revelations -- the end of the world, happening slowly and before his eyes.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to find my news feed full of images of tent camps in Tijuana.\n\nIt had started raining on the migrants.\n\n\"I feel like a street dog,\" one man told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"Wet and cold and with no place to go.\"\n\nCorn crops, shown here, and beans are among the staple foods in the area.\n\n'Migration with dignity'\n\nI didn't say this to the lonesome father, but it's the reality: His sons have very little chance of settling lawfully in the United States if they are able to cross the border.\n\nThat's because there's no legal status for \"climate refugees.\"\n\nThe rules that govern the rights of refugees were developed in the aftermath of World War II and during the early Cold War, when western countries like the United States had an interest in protecting people who were persecuted in the communist Soviet Union, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier write in \"Refuge: Rethinking Refugee Policy for a Changing World.\"\n\nOnly a few specific groups were protected -- those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or social group. The 1951 UN refugee convention says people meeting those criteria should be able to seek asylum outside their home states.\n\nOther types of migration -- including people seeking economic opportunity or those fleeing climate change -- are not protected in a similarly codified way.\n\nThose people are typically not \"refugees\" in the legal sense.\n\nThey're migrants. And if they cross borders, they may break national laws.\n\nNot everyone believes that should be so.\n\nAnote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, one of the small island nations in the Pacific, has advocated for what he calls \"migration with dignity\" -- the opportunity for people from climate-affected areas to relocate if that makes their lives safer or gets them out of danger.\n\n\"There's no harm in being prepared,\" he told me in an interview this fall.\n\nCoffee producers are major employers in the region, and also have struggled.\n\nThat idea runs against the current of nationalism sweeping the globe. From the United States to Hungary, Australia to Denmark, countries have been fortifying walls, filling detention centers and even detaining asylum seekers on castaway islands -- not welcoming them. The United States is accepting far fewer refugees than it has in most years in recent memory.\n\nAttempting to add a \"climate refugee\" category in international law could pose problems of its own. Among them: How do you define who is and is not a climate refugee? Scientists are getting better at finding human fingerprints on heatwaves, droughts and storms that are being supercharged by global warming. But this is a realm of probabilities and complexities. It's difficult to say, with certainty, \"climate change made me move.\" Then there are political concerns, as well. Some scholars argue it's politically dangerous to try to amend international refugee conventions because this is such an anti-refugee moment in history. The process could lead to refugee rights being stripped instead of added. Others contend that the UN refugee convention is so rarely followed that it's almost irrelevant anyway, especially after the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe.\n\n\"If you were to create this whole new category and give people grounds to apply for asylum based on climate, you're likely to get an enormous number of people applying because it's so ill-defined,\" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \"How much below-average rainfall does the rainfall have to be in your region before you're a climate refugee? At present, the primary receiving countries already are experiencing tremendous resistance to the current level of asylees and refugees. It doesn't seem like resettling people in developed counties is going to be much of an answer to this problem. ... A much more effective use of resources is always to help people in place.\"\n\nIt's also unclear that climate change is the main reason people are fleeing Central America, he said; the \"pull factors\" of wealth and opportunity in the United States may be more important.\n\n\"You can think of climate change as one of the push factors,\" he said, \"but it isn't the reason we get the caravan, per se. And it's also important to understand if people were just starving, and they were desperately fleeing the total breakdown of the food chain, why travel 1,500 miles across Mexico to the US border? Mexico has lots of places you could stop to get basic sustenance.\"\n\nA 2018 report from the World Bank proposes two additional solutions.\n\nFirst, cut carbon emissions, which is the aim of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSecond, help would-be migrants adapt to the warmer world. The international Green Climate Fund, which President Trump promised to walk away from, too, has approved projects to help farmers in Central America to become more productive, blunting the force of drought. USAID also has supported irrigation and farming projects in the region, according to a federal official.\n\nDon't let the greenery fool you, scientists say. Western Honduras has been hit with a crop-damaging drought in recent years.\n\nCombined, those two tools could reduce forced, internal displacement from climate change by about 80%, according to the World Bank's \"Groundswell\" report on climate migration.\n\nBarring substantial changes, however, the scope of the migration crisis could be enormous.\n\nAn estimated 17 million people in Latin America could be forced to relocate within their countries because of climate change by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, according to the World Bank report. Across three regions that the World Bank examined -- which also included sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia -- more than 143 million people could be forced to relocate because of global warming.\n\nThat figure doesn't include extreme weather, such as hurricanes, which also are getting worse and tend to get more attention from the news media. The report only looks at slow onset climate disasters, from sea level rise to crop failures and water stress.\n\nIn other words -- events like the drought in Central America.\n\nGerm\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez\n\nThe phone rang in the hilltop community.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez's husband, Germ\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, had left several days before, looking for the caravan, carrying with him a phone number in his pocket in case he could find a way to call the village.\n\nShe'd been worried sick the entire time, scanning for his face on TV.\n\nThe voice did not bring relief.\n\nHer husband was missing, the person said.\n\nLater, she would learn the worst had happened.\n\nRam\u00edrez died on the road in Guatemala.\n\nDelmi Amparo Hern\u00e1ndez buried her husband in the earth he used to till.\n\nThe precise circumstances are unclear to her. Perhaps he was hit by a car while walking along the highway. Perhaps he was hitching a ride in a car that crashed. These are the stories people have relayed. What she knows for sure is that he died October 20 near Guatemala City.\n\nCause of death: severe trauma.\n\nAuthorities were able to bring his body back to the village; she is thankful for that. She buried him on the slope of a mountain above the town, in the same earth he used to till.\n\nShe doesn't know what exactly will become of her family now.\n\nShe hasn't been farming, hasn't been able to.\n\nThe nonprofit World Vision has had to help with food.\n\nBut when she looks at her youngest child, she finds hope.\n\nHe is 3 years old -- and named Germ\u00e1n, like his father, and grandfather, too.\n\nWill he farm this same land?

Several news cycles from now, few will remember what was discussed at the recent G20 summit in Buenos Aires.\n\nNever mind that US lawmakers and other world leaders have castigated the Saudi crown prince over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Putin's embrace of MBS telegraphed a message of unabashed support for Saudi Arabia, even as the Trump administration tries to contain the political fallout from the murder.\n\nPutin is certainly one to sense an opening. His personal outreach builds upon a burgeoning oil alliance between Moscow and Riyadh . Perhaps more importantly, it comes as his well-established rapport with US President Donald Trump is starting to look a little bit wobbly.\n\nAnd it accompanies a confrontation with the US over arms control: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced this week that the US will stop adhering to a decades-old nuclear treaty in 60 days unless Russia returns to compliance with the agreement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before the Helsinki summit in July 2018.\n\nPointed snub to Putin\n\nHow quickly things have changed since the Helsinki summit in July. Less than half a year ago, Trump stunned observers by appearing to side with Putin over the US intelligence community, saying he took the Kremlin leader at his word over his denials of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe G20 summit was originally billed as a sort of Helsinki 2.0: Trump and Putin were supposed to have a lengthy meeting on the sidelines of the summit, where they would have wide-ranging discussions about matters of strategic importance.\n\nThat bilateral meeting, however, was scuttled after an incident around the Kerch Strait, where Russian and Ukrainian vessels clashed at sea on November 25. The confrontation between Kiev and Moscow quickly ramped up: Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 service members, and Trump cancelled his meeting with Putin , saying it would be inappropriate for him to meet while the crisis was unresolved.\n\nIt was a pointed snub to Putin, who said it was a \"pity\" that he was unable to have a full-fledged meeting with Trump, because, as he put it, \"the time is ripe particularly with the problems around strategic stability.\"\n\nTrump's volte-face came after his longtime former attorney Michael Cohen leveled fresh allegations in court about the President's business dealings with Russia. And the Russians were quick to cast doubt on Trump's reasons for canceling the bilateral meeting.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova last week suggested that the \"US domestic political situation\" was the real reason for the cancellation of the G20 meeting.\n\n\"Was the provocation organized by Kiev in this region the real reason for cancellation?\" Zakharova said, referring to the Kerch incident. \"Publicly, we heard just such an explanation, we took note of it. Is this a reality? I think that you still need to look for answers in the US domestic political situation. The dominant factor in making a decision is domestic political realities in the US.\"\n\nKremlin-aligned Russian media had a field day with Trump's cancellation.\n\nPro-Putin news anchor Dmitry Kiselev highlighted the Putin-MBS high-five on his program, adding: \"A dissonant contrast to everyone's mood was Trump, looking morose, sitting there with crossed hands as if he is trying to shield himself from everyone else, scared of blurting out something unnecessary. Looks like he was just not prepared for a coherent meeting with Putin.\"\n\nVladimir Soloviev, another pro-Kremlin presenter, took a similar dig at Trump.\n\n\"Trump's volatility and unpredictability is the new brand of the White House,\" he said.\n\nReset that never came\n\nIn terms of Russia's perception of Trump, things have come a long way since the 2016, when his election victory was treated as a potential breakthrough in Russian-American relations.\n\nKonstantin Kosachev, a Russian senator who is chair of the Federation Council's Committee on Foreign Affairs, summed up the new Russian pessimism about Trump and the United States in an interview with CNN. Like many Russian official observers of the American political scene, Kosachev believes Trump is hamstrung by the ongoing probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"The current American policy towards Russia is not about Russia or the foreign policy of the United States,\" he said. \"It's about the domestic policy of the United States. America is still captured by these disagreements and emotions from the previous presidential campaign. Mr. Trump is being heavily attacked. And one of the tracks of this attack is the Russian meddling in the American elections, which has never been proved by any evidence. So, I believe that our bilateral relations are kept hostage by certain internal political interests of certain political forces inside the US. And I am afraid we will trapped in this situation until the next presidential election.\"\n\nIt's a pivotal moment in Washington, with special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday outlining a previously undisclosed set of overtures and contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals.\n\nFederal prosecutors said for the first time that Michael Cohen acted at the direction of Trump when the former fixer committed two election-related crimes during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSeparately, Mueller said Friday that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied about five major issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \"contact with administration officials.\"\n\nThe accusations by Mueller add to growing signs that the special counsel's team has a wealth of evidence about contacts between people close to Trump -- even in the White House -- and Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nIt also comes after Mueller told a federal court that Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, had given \"substantial assistance\" to the Russia investigation and should not receive jail time.\n\nBut with the Mueller probe coming to a head, Russia's line has been consistent: There was no meddling, therefore the probe is groundless.\n\nAsked in a conference call this week with reporters to comment on the Mueller probe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was dismissive.\n\n\"We have enough other concerns, so this is not a priority topic for our attention, frankly speaking,\" he said. \"I do not know what kind of breakthroughs there could be.

But the 80-year old had another job: he was \"chairman of the board\" of Italy's most powerful mafia group -- the 'Ndrangheta.\n\nThis week, police in four European countries carried out raids on the 'Ndrangheta's sprawling empire of money-laundering and drug-trafficking, arresting 90 people. They described \"Operation Pollino\" -- two years in the making -- as a \"decisive strike against one of the most powerful Italian criminal networks in the world.\"\n\nThe operation took place the day after the alleged head, or \"godfather,\" of the Sicilian mafia, known as Cosa Nostra, was arrested with 46 other people in the Palermo region of Italy on mafia charges.\n\nBut Oppedisano, now in jail after being arrested eight years ago , may not be impressed. The 'Ndrangheta has been the target of raids and even US Treasury sanctions for well over a decade. And yet it has entrenched its dominance of the cocaine trade, forging links with organized crime groualps in Latin America, New York, Turkey and Albania.\n\nMafia watchers estimate its turnover is probably in the range of about $60 billion a year -- similar to the GDP of Croatia or Bulgaria. And it may control as much as 80% of the cocaine entering Europe.\n\nA low profile\n\nIn the early 1990s, Italian authorities went after the Cosa Nostra in Sicily following the killing of two key prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Zora Hauser, a researcher in organized crime at Oxford University, says this both \"significantly weakened the Sicilian mafia and absorbed law enforcement resources.\"\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta saw an opportunity. It kept a low profile but steadily expanded its activities from its stronghold in the mountain villages of Calabria, the \"toe\" of southern Italy.\n\nCecilia Anesi, a journalist who covers organized crime for the Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPI) , has spent time in the group's heartlands. She says a new generation of leaders wanted to find ways to invest proceeds from kidnapping and protection. The answer was cocaine.\n\n\"an investigative journalist who has spent time in the group's heartlands, says a new generation of leaders wanted to find ways to invest proceeds from kidnapping and protection. The answer was cocaine.\n\nSettimino Mineo, jeweller and new head of the Sicilian mafia, is escorted by carabinieri as he leaves a police station following his arrest this week.\n\nItalian court documents describe drug trafficking as \"the gold mine the 'Ndrangheta uses to then invest in the legal economy in Italy and abroad.\"\n\nThe group combined its stubborn rural origins with a flair for innovation. Antonio Nicaso, who has published some 30 books about organized crime including several about the 'Ndrangheta, says it forged ties with drug producers and distributors throughout Latin America: in Peru, Colombia, Guyana and Brazil.\n\nNicaso told CNN it came to control all the major trafficking routes, including ports in Brazil and West Africa. It also established a presence in European ports such as Antwerp and Rotterdam. A front company in Colombia hid huge amounts of cocaine in charcoal exports to Europe; another did the same but with timber from Guyana.\n\nThat Italian place\n\nA US diplomatic cable in 2008 concluded the 'Ndrangheta belied its origins in an Italian backwater, \"maintaining bank accounts in Monte Carlo and Milan and transplanting operatives to Colombia, Spain, Germany, the Balkans, Canada and Australia.\"\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta laundered the rapidly growing proceeds through investments in tourism on the French Riviera, restaurants and real estate in Spain, public contracts in northern Italy. And it turned to the large Calabrian diaspora across Europe (and especially in Germany) to expand.\n\nThe German pizzeria where police arrested an alleged member of the Italian 'Ndrangheta mafia organization on Wednesday.\n\nExploiting family ties, the clans used Italian bistros and cafes from Dusseldorf to south London as fronts for money-laundering operations and the distribution of narcotics. In this week's raids alone, police seized 4,000 kilograms of cocaine and 140 kilos of ecstasy pills, plus large sums of cash.\n\nCecilia Alesi says investigators have evidence that an ice cream parlor in the German town of Bruggen was used to launder money. And a pizza restaurant near Cologne became a logistical base, money-laundering hub and place from which to organize Latin American drug shipments. Restaurants in two Dutch villages played a similar role.\n\nEvery clod of earth\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta began life in the 19th century as rural brigands, taking their name from the Greek word for heroism. Calabria was and remains perfect mafia territory: an unforgiving landscape dominated by the Aspromonte (or Rough Mountains). Remote, secretive and one of the poorest regions in Europe, it is hostile to any form of state authority.\n\nToday, the region is dominated by a few historic families -- like the Pelle, Romeo and Giorgi. The 'Ndrangheta's \"spiritual\" home is the town of San Luca, but different families control municipalities or \"mandamenti.\" In the words of one Italian prosecutor, they control \"every clod of earth\" in southern Calabria.\n\nThe group has not been without internal vendettas. A long-running feud between two families, the Nirta-Strangio and Pelle-Vottari, culminated in an attack on a pizzeria in Duisburg, Germany, in 2007 -- when six young men of the Pelle clan were gunned down.\n\nA boy lays a letter in front of the Italian restaurant \"Da Bruno\" in 2007, after six members of the Pelle clan were shot dead.\n\nHauser says the unwanted spotlight prompted the 'Ndrangheta to form a provincia, a sort of board of directors for settling disputes and approving new affiliations. The elderly Oppedisano may have become its \"chairman\" because he was a consensus figure.\n\nFamily links are often reinforced through marriage, and blood ties have made the 'Ndrangheta more difficult to break down than other mafia groups. Hauser says that within the 'Ndrangheta \"it's almost impossible to distinguish the blood family from the criminal family. On top of that, information within the organization is shared gradually, according to a strict hierarchy.\"\n\nWhile thousands of members of the Cosa Nostra became informants, just a few dozen 'Ndrangheta members have turned -- and none among the top echelon, says Nicaso. The code of silence, or \"omerta,\" remains as powerful as ever. Those who step out of line, as did the group's \"representative\" in northern Italy back in 2008, don't last long.\n\nUS diplomats reported in 2009 that \"most of the politicians we met with on a recent visit [to Calabria] were fatalistic, of the opinion that there was little that could be done to stop the region's downward economic spiral or the stranglehold of the 'Ndrangheta.\"\n\nThe chameleon\n\nWaves of arrests over the last decade has certainly disrupted the group. A sweep in 2010 netted some 300 arrests (including of several policemen).\n\nNicaso says the creation of a Joint Investigation Team across Europe two years ago was a big step forward -- joining the dots of 'Ndrangheta activity across borders through intelligence-sharing.\n\nInvestigators also took advantage of new technology -- planting software in the cell phone of Domenico Pelle, allegedly a senior lieutenant in the organization (even at the age of 27), who was arrested this week. It secretly recorded not only his conversations but even ambient audio, according to Cecilia Anesi.\n\nEU agency Eurojust says this week's operation was the \"biggest of its kind to date in Europe.\"\n\nThose are the positives. But Oxford University researcher Zora Hauser told CNN this operation won't hinder the group's ability to function.\n\n\"It has arguably weakened some families, but one of the strengths of the 'Ndrangheta is that clans benefit from a high level of autonomy. The weakening of one family can easily translate into the strengthening of another.\"\n\nOne Italian police official has described the group as like a chameleon, changing the way it works but always retaining its invisible base in the Calabrian mountains. It has thoroughly penetrated local politics and is capable of turning municipal elections in favor of one candidate or another. It provided prostitutes for one judge.

Not coincidentally, Canadian authorities are publicly discussing a similar ban following last week\u2019s arrest of Huawei\u2019s CFO.\n\nJapan\u2019s decision comes less than a month after the United States reportedly lobbied several overseas allies to block Chinese cellular hardware from their wireless networks, in part due to concerns over monitoring of U.S. military base communications. According to reports, the U.S. floated the prospect of financial subsidies for compliant countries, alongside the threat of reduced assistance to non-compliant ones.\n\nKyodo reports that the Japanese government complied, and is coordinating with top cellular providers to remove Huawei and ZTE hardware from their networks. Three carriers have agreed to stop using Chinese 4G equipment and not introduce new 5G hardware into their networks. A soon-to-be-launched fourth carrier has also said it will not use Chinese networking gear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely crucial not to procure equipment that embeds malicious functions including information theft and destruction,\u201d said Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary, noting that the country is now studying what to do with already purchased Chinese hardware. Top carrier Softbank has indicated that it will replace Chinese 4G cellular products with U.S. and European alternatives, while rivals NTT Docomo, KDDI, and Rakuten will avoid using Huawei and ZTE networking hardware in their 5G infrastructures.\n\nNotably, none of the Japanese carriers will stop selling consumer devices such as phones and tablets from Huawei or ZTE, as they are not believed to impact core network security. That\u2019s unlikely to change in the immediate future, giving users the ability to keep purchasing comparatively inexpensive Chinese products \u2014 albeit with potential security risks.\n\nHuawei has strongly denied accusations that its products constitute any form of security risk, and continues to offer its 5G networking hardware to carriers in South America, Africa, and Asia. ZTE was nearly forced to stop doing business entirely after a brief but hastily modified ban by the U.S. government, and actively turned its attention to pitching Japanese cellular companies, apparently without success.\n\nChina\u2019s government has responded forcefully to each of the international bans, most recently defending Huawei and ZTE in a statement (via Google Translate) ahead of the Japanese government\u2019s decision. But the protestations have generally fallen on deaf ears, and U.S. officials have continued to lobby friendly intelligence agencies across the world.\n\nNorthern neighbor Canada could be the next major U.S. ally to block Huawei from its communications networks. U.S. lawmakers lobbied Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a ban on Huawei 5G gear in October, but the government was largely quiet until shortly after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou \u2014 daughter of the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei \u2014 was arrested in Canada last week on charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nThough Canadian authorities have described the arrest as non-political, it brought longstanding issues with Huawei to greater attention in the Canadian media. Shortly after The Globe and Mail published a scathing opinion piece on Huawei, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for the company to be banned, suggesting that western allies needed to hold China accountable for \u201crule breaking\u201d that imperiled its trade relationships with partners. \u201cI obviously note that the United States is encouraging western allies to essentially push Huawei out of the emerging 5G network,\u201d Harper said, \u201cand my personal view is that that is something western countries should be doing in terms of our own long-term security issues.\u201d\n\nSoon thereafter, the Toronto Sun built upon Harper\u2019s comments in an anti-Huawei editorial, saying that the company couldn\u2019t be trusted to participate in Canada\u2019s 5G network. And in a separate interview today, Canada\u2019s Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told the National Post that the country is relying upon input from its intelligence services in deciding whether to ban Huawei, putting national security first in the decision.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no timetable yet for Canada\u2019s decision on Huawei, and Champagne has said that the issue is too important to be rushed, time is running out if the country hopes to deploy 5G over the next year. Huawei participated in 5G testing with Canadian carrier Telus in February, but by March, Canadian authorities began to question the wisdom of deploying Huawei 5G hardware.

Gitlin"], "text": "If anyone thought that Elon Musk had turned over a new leaf following a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over illegally manipulating Tesla's stock price, think again. On Sunday, CBS' 60 Minutes interviewed the Tesla CEO, which gave Musk an opportunity to let the world know exactly what he thinks about SEC. Spoiler alert: not much.\n\nAs you may recall, this all started in August, when Musk took to Twitter to tell his 23.6 million followers that he had secured funding to return Tesla to private ownership via way of an oblique drug reference.\n\nDespite adding \"Funding secured,\" it turned out there was in fact no such commitment. The resulting yo-yo effect on Tesla's stock price led to a deluge of complaints with the SEC from investors both short and long who lost money as a result, and it caused us to question whether or not Musk's presence at Tesla was actually a good thing for the company.\n\nIn this case, the SEC took action rather rapidly. The South African-born CEO rejected the initial settlement offer, at which point the SEC sued him for fraud. By late September, the case was settled to avoid a trial; both Musk and Tesla were each fined $20 million. There were also several other conditions, including a requirement for Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla's board (he remains CEO) and for Tesla to institute some form of oversight over Musk's tweets to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.\n\nBut there were almost immediate signs that Musk had no intention of being told what to do by any federal regulators, particularly not ones he dubbed the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission.\" Further eyebrows were raised when it was revealed that the new, supposedly independent board chairperson would be Robyn Denholm, the CFO of an Australian telecommunications company; she will remain in Australia for the time being.\n\nFollowing Sunday's interview, there is no longer any need to read between the lines. Musk made it clear that, despite a settlement that requires \"mandatory procedures\u2026 regarding oversight of communications relating to the Company made in any format, including but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g Twitter),\" no one is looking over his shoulder or telling him not to tweet.\n\nStahl: Have you had any of your tweets censored since the settlement? Musk: No. Stahl: None? Does someone have to read them before they go out? Musk: No. Stahl: So your tweets are not supervised? Musk: The only tweets that would have to be, say, reviewed, would be if a tweet had a probability of causing a movement in the stock. Stahl: And that's it? Musk: Yeah, I mean, otherwise it's \"Hello, First Amendment.\" Like freedom of speech is fundamental. Stahl: But how do they know if it's gong to move the market if they're not reading all of them before you send them? Musk: Well I guess we might make some mistakes. Who knows? Stahl: Are you serious? Musk: Nobody's perfect. Stahl: Look at you. Musk: I want to be clear, I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.\n\nIn response to being asked whether Denholm was appointed to watch over Musk \"like a babysitter,\" he rejected the very idea. \"That\u2019s not realistic, in the sense that I\u2019m the largest shareholder in the company, and I can just call for a shareholder vote and get anything done that I want,\" Musk told Stahl.\n\nIn a statement from Tesla to Ars on Monday, the company told us, \"We can confirm the settlement is being complied with. This includes having a policy (which technically needs to be in place by December 28) that requires pre-approval of any communications that reasonably could contain material information.\"\n\nFurther, Tesla sent us a portion of the interview transcript regarding Musk's remarks about Denholm that had been edited down by 60 Minutes. In response to the \"babysitter\" question, Musk's full answer was as follows:\n\nI mean that\u2019s not realistic, because I am the largest shareholder in the company and a very high percentage of the shareholders support me and the company. So essentially I could just pull for a shareholder vote and get anything that I want provided I could get support for at least a 1/3 of the other shareholders. Not certain, but likely. At the end of the day the shareholders pull the vote.\n\nAs Tesla pointed out, the settlement does not require oversight of Musk's Twitter feed until almost the end of the year, so technically Musk has not broken the agreement. However, it may not be coincidental that on Friday, the company announced it had hired Dale Butswinkas\u2014a leading trial lawyer\u2014as the company's new general counsel.

But steer clear of this temptation \u2014 eating or tasting unbaked products that are intended to be cooked, such as dough or batter, can make you sick.\"\n\nThe CDC goes on to explain that uncooked flour could contain e coli bacteria and that raw eggs pose a risk of getting sick from salmonella. On the surface, those sound pretty bad. That said, it's important to put things in perspective. Sure, eating cookie dough can make you sick \u2014 but it probably won't.\n\nIt's estimated that only about 1 in 20,000 eggs contain salmonella. Bakers wishing to eliminate such risk could theoretically use pasteurized eggs (though that may mean sacrificing taste).\n\nAs far as flour, yes, there was an e coli outbreak in 2016 tied to flour that is believed to have caused 63 people to get sick, and it led to a General Mills flour recall. But that this is not a common occurrence, and even taking it into account, it's a relatively small number given that Americans consume over 130 pounds of wheat flour per capita each year.\n\nSure, it's theoretically possible that a batch of cookie dough you make could contain relatively rare infected eggs or flour, but Americans routinely engage in behaviors that carry risks. Adults and their kids ride bikes, ski, play sports, eat at restaurants whose kitchens they haven't thoroughly vetted, and so on. They determine ultimately that the fun is worth the risk, so why shouldn't the same logic apply to cookie dough?\n\nThere's also an issue of degree. If you routinely make large bowls of cookie dough purely for the purpose of consuming it raw, it will increase your odds of getting sick. But if, like most people, you make a batch of cookies and lick some raw leftover dough off of the spoon, the risk of getting sick is statistically low.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees. Sure, if you're a generally a risk-averse person, you may decide to err on the side of avoiding consuming raw dough and keep it from your children.

The company has been racing to develop 5G technology and is central to China's plans to dominate the rollout of super-fast wireless networks\n\nThe company says its equipment is trusted by customers in 170 countries. And it still performs well, reporting $47.4 billion in revenue for the first half of 2018. That's an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year.\n\nWho is Meng Wanzhou?\n\nMeng, who is also known as Sabrina Meng and Cathy Meng, is Huawei's chief financial officer and serves as the deputy chairwoman of Huawei's board. Notably, she's the daughter of Huawei's elusive founder , Ren Zhengfei.\n\nAside from a brief stint at China Construction Bank, the 46-year-old executive has spent her entire career at Huawei. Her brother, Meng Ping, also known as Ren Ping, works at a Huawei subsidiary, and there was speculation that they were being groomed for succession. The Huawei founder reportedly shot that down in a letter to employees in 2013, saying his children lacked the vision, character and ambition to lead the company.\n\nWhat do we know about her arrest?\n\nJUST WATCHED Erin Burnett presses Trump official on arrest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Erin Burnett presses Trump official on arrest 03:28\n\nMeng is believed to have helped Huawei circumvent US sanctions by telling financial institutions that a Huawei subsidiary was a separate company, prosecutors said at Meng's bail hearing on Friday.\n\nThe hearing provided the first detailed look into the reasons behind Meng's arrest. The judge, after listening to arguments from Meng's lawyer and prosecutors, did not rule on bail and said the hearing would resume Monday.\n\nPreviously, details on why Meng had been detained were limited due to a press ban. A judge had accepted Meng's request to bar both police and prosecutors from releasing information about the case prior to the hearing. The ban was lifted on Friday.\n\nIn a statement after Friday's hearing in Canada, Huawei said: \"We will continue to follow the bail hearing on Monday. We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach the right conclusion.\"\n\nThe company has said it was \"not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng\" and that it \"complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates.\"\n\nMeng's attorney said she would not breach a court order because doing so would embarrass her personally, and would also humiliate her father, Huawei and China itself. He added that the case against Meng had not been fully laid out, even though the US signed off on her arrest warrant months ago.\n\n\"This isn't some last minute thing,\" he said.\n\nMeng did everything she could to be transparent with Huawei's banking partners, and the company always worked to ensure its compliance with sanctions law, her lawyer continued.\n\nHow has China responded?\n\nMeng's arrest has struck a nerve in China. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 6 called for Meng to be released and for the United States and Canada to explain why she'd been detained. Two days later, China summoned the Canadian ambassador to address Meng's detention, calling her arrest \"lawless, reasonless and ruthless.\"\n\nState-owned newspaper the Global Times said in an editorial that the arrest shows Washington is \"resorting to a despicable rogue's approach as it cannot stop Huawei's 5G advance in the market.\" It said the move \"obviously goes against the consensus\" reached by US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade, who met over the weekend in Argentina.\n\nWhat does this mean for the trade war?\n\nThe arrest could jeopardize an already precarious ceasefire in the conflict between the United States and China over trade and technology.\n\n\"This type of action will affect the atmosphere around the negotiations \u2014 making them less likely to bring a sustainable settlement,\" Eurasia Group political risk analysts said in a note to clients.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday it was confident a trade agreement with the United States could still be reached in time to hit a 90-day deadline set by Trump.

Graff", "Virginia Heffernan"], "text": "Before they hand control of the House of Representatives over to Democrats, House Republicans are mounting one more effort to hold Silicon Valley giants accountable for what they say is rampant liberal bias at tech companies. In the hot seat this time: Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pichai will testify before the House Judiciary Committee in a hearing focused on transparency, data collection, and filtering. Until now, Pichai has mostly avoided the public lashings in Washington that his contemporaries, like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, have received. In September, Google declined to send either Pichai or Larry Page, CEO of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, to testify alongside Dorsey and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senators instead vented their frustrations with Google to an empty chair, artfully reserved with a name plate for Page.\n\nPichai has since held closed door meetings with leading Republicans, including House majority leader Kevin McCarthy, who has repeatedly accused Google of skewing its search results in favor of Democrats and their causes. Both McCarthy and Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte have signaled that these charges will be central to the committee\u2019s questioning.\n\n\u201cOnline technology is now an integral part of most Americans\u2019 modern lifestyle,\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement announcing the hearing. \u201cHowever, the technology behind online services like social media and Internet search engines can also be used to suppress particular viewpoints and manipulate public opinion.\u201d\n\nIn his prepared remarks, released by the committee Monday night, Pichai defended Google against such attacks. \"I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\" he wrote. \"We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions\u2014and we have no shortage of them among our own employees.\"\n\nThat won't likely stop conservatives on the committee from crying censorship. As with so many of these hearings, you can be certain there will be plenty of partisan grandstanding. But for those lawmakers interested in doing more than pandering to the party, there are plenty of pressing questions regarding the way Google works. Congress should want answers. Here are just a few.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee's hearing will begin at 10 AM ET on Tuesday. WIRED will have a live stream of the hearing here.\n\nWhy did Google change its mind about pursuing business in China?\n\nGoogle has faced vehement opposition from employees and members of both parties over its plans to explore building a censored search engine for China, which was first reported by The Intercept this summer. After all, the company loudly shut down its Chinese search offerings in 2010 over concerns about censorship. Now the question is: What changed?\n\nSo far, Google executives have been tight-lipped about the program, called Dragonfly. At the Senate hearing where Google was a no-show in September, senators condemned Google's renewed interest in China and suggested it was one reason top executives declined their invitation. During a second hearing with the Senate Commerce Committee later that month, lawmakers repeatedly pressed the company's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, to tell them more about Dragonfly. Enright mostly repeated a vague talking point.\n\nSince then, Pichai has at least admitted to Dragonfly's existence and offered some semblance of an explanation for it. \"Our mission is to provide information to everyone, and [China] is 20 percent of the world's population,\" Pichai told WIRED in October. \"We wanted to learn what it would look like if Google were in China. That's what we've built internally.\"\n\nAnd yet, there are still so many unanswered questions. Pichai also told WIRED that the Dragonfly experiment showed that in China, Google would still be able to carry out \"well over 99 percent\" of people's searches. The more pertinent question, though, is what types of searches are prohibited? And why does Google feel that amount of censorship is palatable?\n\nThen there's the question of what access the Chinese government will have to people's search history. According to The Intercept, the Dragonfly system requires users to log in to perform a search, tracks users' locations, and shares data back with a Chinese third party. Google has scarcely commented on these particulars. With Pichai under oath, lawmakers could change that on Tuesday.\n\nWhat is Google doing to prevent new ad fraud schemes popping up across its platforms and Android apps?\n\nGoogle commands the largest share of digital advertising revenue in the country. It has also found itself at the center of two massive ad fraud schemes in just the last few months. In October, Buzzfeed News reported on a network of 125 Android apps and websites that were tracking user behavior, only to mimic it with a network of bots and scam advertisers out of \"potentially hundreds of millions of dollars\" by targeting ads at those bots. (Google estimates the damage was more like $10 million.)\n\nThen just last month, Google removed two apps from the Play store that Buzzfeed News also found to be committing fraud. These apps, based in China, were tracking users' app downloads, falsely claiming credit for the downloads, and then banking the referral fees from those apps.\n\nIn both cases, Google removed the apps involved in the schemes. The company also assisted the US government in its investigation into criminal ad fraud rings, which resulted in eight indictments late last month. But questions remain about how these scams fell through the cracks in Google's security system and what should be done about it. Senator Mark Warner, vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been pressuring the Federal Trade Commission to hold Google accountable for these cyber crimes. Members of the House could amplify that pressure.\n\nWhen did Google first understand the extent of Google+'s vulnerabilities, and why didn't the company act faster?\n\nOn Monday, just a day before Pichai was set to testify, Google announced that a Google+ bug exposed data from 52.5 million accounts. It's the second Google+ exposure discovered this year. In October, The Wall Street Journal reported on another bug that exposed 500,000 accounts, which Google had previously kept quiet to avoid \u201cimmediate regulatory interest,\u201d according to a company memo obtained by the Journal.\n\nThat same month, Google announced it would be shutting down Google+ for consumers in August of 2019, due in part to security concerns unearthed during a company-wide privacy and security audit. But the most recent breach, which resulted from a November software update, hastened that timeline: The company is now pulling Google+'s APIs within 90 days.\n\nThe question for Pichai is how early Google became aware of Google+'s many vulnerabilities and why it didn't move sooner to protect its users.\n\nWhy does Google track location data of users who have location history disabled?\n\nAn Associated Press investigation in August found that Google tracks smartphone users' location data, even when those users have turned off the Location History setting on their phones. At the time, Google's support page claimed that \"With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.\" After the AP report was published, the company updated the language to say, \"Your settings for other location services on your device, like Google Location Services and Find My Device, are not changed.\" This impacts Android users and iPhone users who have the Google Maps app.\n\nGoogle said it collects this data to \"improve people\u2019s experience\" and allows people to delete this history whenever they want. And yet, the off switch is buried deep in users' Google account settings, not to mention the fact that users who have already disabled their location history might reasonably believe that applies to all location history.\n\nAt a hearing ostensibly focused on transparency, the difference between consumers' privacy expectations and Google's corporate practices seem more than relevant.\n\nSpeaking of privacy, what does Google want out of a federal privacy bill?\n\nTech giants have been lobbying hard for a federal privacy bill that would supersede a stricter bill set to take effect in California in January 2020. Google has released a policy paper outlining in broad strokes its vision for a federal law. A law should \"mandate transparency and help individuals be informed\" and require companies to \"collect and use personal information responsibly.\" But the paper offers few details about what that would mean in practice.\n\nWhat level of control should consumers have? What limits should there be in terms of the amount and types of data businesses can collect on people in the first place? How would those limits change the way Google does business? Who should enforce such a law, and how should violators be punished?\n\nYou can be sure these are questions that Google's lobbyists are already asking and answering behind closed doors. As the law takes shape, it's in everyone's best interest to get them out into the open.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories", "keywords": ["search", "congress", "hearing", "users", "committee", "ask", "pichai", "sundar", "data", "google", "company", "location", "googles", "questions"], "summary": "On Tuesday, Pichai will testify before the House Judiciary Committee in a hearing focused on transparency, data collection, and filtering.\nThe question for Pichai is how early Google became aware of Google+'s many vulnerabilities and why it didn't move sooner to protect its users.\nWhy does Google track location data of users who have location history disabled?\nAn Associated Press investigation in August found that Google tracks smartphone users' location data, even when those users have turned off the Location History setting on their phones.\nYou can be sure these are questions that Google's lobbyists are already asking and answering behind closed doors."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/09/weather/winter-storm-sunday-wxc/index.html", "published": "2018-12-09T16:16:00", "title": "1 weather-related death reported in North Carolina amid snow storm", "author": ["Holly Yan", "Madeline Holcombe", "Amir Vera"], "text": "(CNN) One weather-related death has been reported in North Carolina as a result of this weekend's snowstorm.\n\nPolice in Matthews, about 12 miles south of Charlotte, said a tree fell on a vehicle.

Trump, who has pledged a manufacturing rebirth in the Midwest, reacted angrily to GM\u2019s \u201dtransformation \u201d announcement late last month, declaring that his administration was \u201clooking at cutting all GM subsidies, including for electric cars.\u201d\n\nRead: Fiat Chrysler to open new auto plant in Detroit\n\nThe company already is on the verge of being phased out of the tax credit program unless Congress changes a law that caps the break at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Without the incentive, GM may be forced to cut the price of its electric cars to keep prospective customers from taking their business elsewhere, according to automotive industry experts.\n\nAs evidence of the credit\u2019s importance to GM\u2019s future, the automaker has expanded its lobbying footprint in Washington and even joined forces with two rivals, Tesla TSLA, +2.01% and Nissan 7201, -3.10% , to call for 200,000-vehicle limit to be scrapped.\n\nRead: Elon Musk slams SEC, says Tesla\u2019s critics have been \u2018unfair\u2019 and \u2018outrageous\u2019\n\nStanding in the way of that goal is Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Barrasso introduced legislation in October to abolish the tax credit, a move he said would save about $20 billion over the next 10 years. He has argued the market for electric vehicles is already established and \u201cno longer needs the crutch of government assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea of the subsidies had to do with trying to make sure that electric vehicles would be a viable technology,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cWell, that\u2019s clearly there.\u201d\n\nThe tax credit came up briefly during a private meeting on Wednesday between Ohio\u2019s senators, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Sherrod Brown, and GM chief executive Mary Barra, according to a congressional aide familiar with the conversation. As part of the restructuring, GM said it will stop making the Chevy Cruze at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant by March and is considering closing the plant for good.\n\nPortman told Barra that it\u2019s difficult to help with priorities such as the electric vehicle credit when GM is moving production out of Ohio, according to the aide, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nOne of the lobbyists working to salvage the credit for GM is Kent Hance, a former chancellor of Texas Tech University who is well connected in GOP circles, according to his online profile . Hance lists his role as a fundraiser for the campaigns of outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and others. He has known Rick Perry, the energy secretary and former Texas governor, for nearly 30 years.\n\nGM in early August named a former Trump White House official, Everett Eissenstat, its senior vice president for global public policy, a post that oversees the company\u2019s lobbying operations. Eissenstat, however, is not registered as a lobbyist, according to disclosure records filed with Congress. Before coming to GM, he was Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for international economic affairs.\n\nUnder federal law, the $7,500 credit for buyers begins to phase out after a manufacturer has sold 200,000 qualifying electric vehicles. GM has estimated it will hit that threshold by the end of December, just as the Bolt will be facing new and potentially stiff competition.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, a senior analyst at Navigant Research, said Hyundai and Kia each will be selling compact SUVs in the U.S. beginning early next year that can travel 240 miles on a single battery charge, about the same as the Bolt. Ford will be launching a number of new plug-in hybrid models in 2019, including the Lincoln Aviator, Explorer and Escape.\n\n\u201cWith the intensifying market shift away from cars to utility vehicles all of these are expected to be more popular than the Bolt,\u201d Abuelsamid said. To remain competitive against the new entries, \u201cGM will likely have to cut the (retail price) of the Bolt as well as any additional EVs they launch next year by the corresponding reduction in the tax credits,\u201d he said.\n\nKarl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, said the credit is \u201chugely important\u201d to electric vehicle manufacturers. Lowering the up-front cost of the vehicle typically plays a significant role in sales, he said, citing surveys that show more consumers would buy electric vehicles if the cars were affordably priced.\n\nGM joined forces with Tesla and Nissan as well as several consumer and environmental groups to broaden its lobbying push even further. The EV Drive Coalition, which was launched in November, urged lawmakers in an open letter last week to put a provision in the must-pass government spending bill that does away with the 200,000-car limit.\n\n\u201cEliminating the per-manufacturer cap will level the playing field for all EV manufacturers and spur innovation among domestic manufacturers, ensuring America\u2019s leadership in the hyper-competitive, global auto market,\u201d the coalition said.\n\nJeannine Ginivan, a GM spokeswoman, said the tax credit should be modified but declined to say whether the automaker backs a specific piece of legislation that would remove the cap.\n\n\u201cWe believe an important part of reaching a zero emissions future and establishing the U.S. as the leader in electrification is to continue to provide a federal tax credit to help make electric vehicles more affordable for all customers,\u201d Ginivan said in an email.\n\nIn addition to GM\u2019s in-house lobbyists, four lobbyists from Hance Scarborough, the Austin, Texas-based firm that Hance founded in 1994, are working on GM\u2019s behalf, including Hance, according to disclosure records.\n\nGM also contracted with two other lobbying firms earlier this year to focus on electric and automated vehicle issues: the Polaris-Hutton Group and the DS2 Group. A fourth firm, the S-3 Group, was hired by GM in 2014 and earlier this year added the tax credit to its portfolio of lobbying issues.", "keywords": ["tax", "gms", "fights", "electric", "lobbying", "gm", "retain", "hance", "washington", "credit", "vehicle", "7500", "according", "vehicles", "cars"], "summary": "Preserving the $7,500 tax incentive for buyers is crucial for GM GM, -0.78% as the company pivots from internal combustion engines in favor of building cars powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.\nIt helps make plug-ins such as the $36,000 Chevy Bolt more affordable at a time when competition from other electric vehicle makers is heating up.\nBarrasso introduced legislation in October to abolish the tax credit, a move he said would save about $20 billion over the next 10 years.\nHe has argued the market for electric vehicles is already established and \u201cno longer needs the crutch of government assistance.\u201d\u201cThe idea of the subsidies had to do with trying to make sure that electric vehicles would be a viable technology,\u201d Barrasso said.\nUnder federal law, the $7,500 credit for buyers begins to phase out after a manufacturer has sold 200,000 qualifying electric vehicles."}, {"link": "https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Trump-administration-rolling-back-Michelle-Obamas-school-lunch-rules-502378041.html", "published": "2018-12-10T20:14:09", "title": "Trump administration rolling back Michelle Obama's school lunch rules", "author": ["Kwch", "Nick Viviani"], "text": "President Donald Trump's administration last week relaxed school-lunch rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama and meant to make school lunches healthier.\n\nThe program is now again making room on menus for noodles, biscuits and other foods made of refined grains.

Graff", "Jeffrey Van Camp"], "text": "Every winter, millions of Americans descend on farms and lots across the country with the express purpose of inspecting, and ultimately choosing from, their local selection of coniferous evergreen trees. I'm talking, of course, about Christmas tree shopping\u2014the widely practiced pastime of publicly scrutinizing spruces, pines, and firs in search of the ideal yuletide centerpiece.\n\nMany people are practiced at picking the perfect tree. They'll judge on things like color, size, shape, needle quality, and bushiness. But behind the annual selection of a coniferous house guest\u2014some 30 million of them a year, in the US\u2014is a ton of science.\n\nTo Bert Cregg, identifying exactly what makes a tree perfect is more than a holiday tradition, it's a major part of his job. He's a forest researcher at Michigan State University and a renowned expert on Christmas tree production. His work covers two main areas: genetics and culture techniques. \"Basically, how can we identify species and seed sources that are going to lead to better Christmas trees, and how can growers manage their farms to produce better trees,\" he says.\n\nThe research Cregg and his colleagues are conducting today will likely influence what type of Christmas tree you buy from your local lot a decade from now.\n\nConsider Cregg's cold-hardiness experiments, one of which he's currently performing inside a chest freezer in the basement of MSU's Plant and Soil Sciences Building. \"We collect a bunch of shoots from the trees we want to study, stick them in the freezer, and program it to decrease 3 degrees Celsius every hour,\" Cregg says. Every 60 minutes, he and his team retrieve some shoots\u2014at minus 3, minus 6, minus 9, minus 12\u2014until the freezer reaches minus 45 degrees Celsius, which is as cold as it goes. Then they incubate the samples.\n\nA week later, they inspect the shoots to see which ones have begun to brown\u2014a sign of damage\u2014and at what temperature. The thinking goes that the colder a given species of tree can get before browning, the more resilient it will be in frigid climates. And the more resilient a tree is, the more likely it is to endure multiple winters and still come out looking living-room ready. \"So, if we're thinking of selecting a new species or seed source, we can screen [that species] rapidly, rather than waiting for that 1-in-20 winter to determine if a tree is hardy enough for a given location,\" Cregg says.\n\nHardiness is but one of many coniferous characteristics Cregg studies in pursuit of increasingly perfect Christmas trees. There\u2019s also size and color, for starters. Farmers see to both by fertilizing often; regular mulches keep trees verdant and growing at a rate of roughly one foot per year. But historically, growers overdid it. Old guidelines prescribed around 300 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer per acre\u2014way more than the trees needed. Microbes in the soil would convert the excess nitrogen into nitrate, which would work its way past the tree's roots, deep into the soil, and infiltrate the ground water. Cregg's lab showed that farmers could reduce their fertilizer requirements by two-thirds if they applied it on a per-tree basis, according to the size, species, and age of their trees. The result was greener trees, less nitrogen runoff, and more money in farmers' pockets.\n\nThere's also things like needle retention\u2014literally, how many needles stay stuck to the branch, and how many rain down on the presents underneath? Cregg and his colleagues assess this by plucking sprigs from a variety of fir species and displaying them in rows at a horticultural farm on campus. Once a week, a researcher will swing through, give each sprig a gentle tug along its length, and tally how many needles fall off. \"We simply go through, give a pull, and we have a rating scale based on how many needles drop,\" Cregg says. \"We can display a Fraser fir for six weeks, and it won't drop any needles. Noble fir, same thing. And that's one reason people in the Northwest like noble firs.\"\n\nAnd then there are issues like coning, and how to deal with it. Coning as in pinecones, which, in this context, are a bad thing. \"Anybody on the outside looking in would probably say: Why's that an issue?\" Cregg says. \"I get it. It's a little out there. But cones are probably the single biggest problem our growers face here in the Midwest.\"\n\nTake Fraser firs, for example. It's the tree of choice for farmers in Michigan and North Carolina, the country's third- and second-biggest growers of Christmas trees, respectively, behind Oregon. In nature, most firs don't produce cones until they're 15 years old, but on farms\u2014most of which harvest trees no later than their tenth season\u2014they'll appear after only a few years. They bud in the spring and develop through the summer, robbing the trees of resources. (From an evolutionary perspective, reproduction comes first, so the trees sink their energy into producing cones.) But the cones don't stick around. Come fall they disintegrate, showering the tree in unsightly fragments.\n\nSo in the springtime, growers pick the cones. By hand. It's not difficult, exactly; if you time it right, a bud the size of your little finger will pop right off, with a twist. But it takes forever: An individual tree can carry hundreds of cones. On a big one you might pluck a thousand. With millions of firs growing across the US, and most of them experiencing some kind of coning, we're talking about billions of cones.\n\nCregg thinks plant growth regulators, which nerf the cone-promoting hormone in firs, could help curb the problem. For the past few years, he's been working to identify the ideal regulator, and how best to apply it. His latest approach isn't perfect, he says, but it can reduce coning by about half. It also has the desirable side effect of keeping trees nice and dense. The main hangup: Applying growth regulators doesn't yet make financial sense. \"Biologically it works, but it's not quite to the point of being cost effective,\" Cregg says.\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious Christmas tree science happening today is a multi-institutional endeavor called CoFirGE. Short for Collaborative Fir Germplasm Evaluation Project, CoFirGE is a nationwide effort whose goals include identifying new species of fir for Christmas trees. There are between 30 and 40 species of firs worldwide, a small handful of which are currently grown for the North American Christmas tree market. Two of today's most popular trees\u2014the Fraser and noble fir\u2014both struggle with a condition called root rot. Caused by the water-mold genus Phytophthora, a tree stricken with it can die in a matter of days. It's currently a huge problem in America's biggest tree-growing states, but in Turkey, fir trees are resistant to root rot. So today, through the CoFirGE project, there are species of Turkish fir growing in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, North Carolina, Washington, and Oregon, to see how adaptable they are to US climates.\n\nAll things to keep in mind, the next time you find yourself wandering the rows of evergreens at your local lot. Remember: Long before you arrived to judge the local stock on things like color, shape, and freshness, scientists like Cregg were stashing firs in freezers and pulling at pine needles, all in pursuit of a more perfect Christmas tree.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories", "keywords": ["science", "species", "firs", "fir", "tree", "cones", "perfect", "christmas", "cregg", "needles", "trees", "growing"], "summary": "Many people are practiced at picking the perfect tree.\nTo Bert Cregg, identifying exactly what makes a tree perfect is more than a holiday tradition, it's a major part of his job.\nHe's a forest researcher at Michigan State University and a renowned expert on Christmas tree production.\nHardiness is but one of many coniferous characteristics Cregg studies in pursuit of increasingly perfect Christmas trees.\nPerhaps the most ambitious Christmas tree science happening today is a multi-institutional endeavor called CoFirGE."}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/10/fear-of-interest-rate-hikes-is-fading-as-next-fed-meeting-approaches.html", "published": "2018-12-11T00:02:44", "title": "Fear of interest rate hikes is fading as next Fed meeting approaches", "author": ["Patti Domm", "Adam Jeffery"], "text": "The fear of the Fed is fading.\n\nAs the 10-week stock market correction deepened, fears of slowing growth escalated and expectations for Fed rate hikes have fallen. While stocks weakened, investors jumped into bonds, sending yields lower and igniting worries about a looming recession.\n\nAs of Monday, the odds were pretty low in the futures market that the Fed would raise interest rates more than one more time, though traders still expect the Fed to hike the fed funds rate by a quarter point next week. Stocks closed higher Monday, after the S&P 500 bounced off its early October low, and tech rallied as market leader Apple turned around.\n\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.2 percent to 2,637 but is still down more than 11 percent from its September high. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, also rose as investors sold bonds. The easing of anxiety in markets was paralleled by a view that the Fed might be easier in its approach to interest rate policy.\n\n\"To us the trade war and the Fed are the two biggest headwinds for the market,\" said Julian Emanuel, head U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG. \"I think part of the reason we're not lower right now is that the market is starting to discount the probability of the Fed not moving next week.\"\n\nEmanuel said the expectations for a hike, based on the futures market, were less than 70 percent. \"If you're less than 75 percent, there's a good chance the Fed won't go,\" he said. While most Fed watchers expect a hike when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19, there is definitely a different tone in the market.\n\n\"They could just basically say: We're going to sit back, we're going to see how things develop, you fix China and those kinds of things,\" Emanuel said. Like many other strategists, Emanuel does not predict a recession next year, but the economy is expected to grow at a slower pace and the trade wars raise concerns that earnings growth could slow even more.\n\n\"The Fed's ability to surprise the market has kind of diminished. They've been so transparent. They gave us this playbook that they're going to follow,\" said Boris Rjavinski, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \"They kept telling us they're data dependent and the data's getting a little softer. If you rank it on a relative scale of where the possibility of the greatest surprise would be coming from now, it's politics. It's not monetary policy for the time being.\"\n\nMost Fed watchers still expect a December rate hike, but the fact that there is doubt about it shows the high level of anxiety in markets about both the economy and financial conditions, or the behavior of markets themselves. The fact that the November employment report Friday came in at just 155,000 payrolls, about 45,000 less than expected, also added to the sentiment that the Fed would have room to pause.\n\n\"You had this repricing with no new data, and the Federal Reserve officials are in the blackout period. The only new development was Brexit \u2026 and especially the increased probability there could be a hard Brexit,\" said Jon Hill, BMO fixed income strategist. He said expectations for a March rate hike are just 12 percent, down from 20 percent early Monday.\n\nHill said the market is now pricing in just 60 percent of one quarter-point hike for all of next year. It had been pricing in one full hike last week.\n\nBut with Fed officials sounding more dovish and concerned about global growth, the Fed as an issue has fallen into the background somewhat. The markets are still fearful trade wars will hurt growth, as could geopolitical uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the special counsel's investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It just feels like this is a time where people realize that political risks are of major consequence to the market, whether it's Brexit, France, the special counsel's investigation, the fact we now have a diplomatic skirmish with China as well as a trade war. You put it all together and it's a lot for the market to handle, particularly during a part of the year where the liquidity tends to become less liquid in terms of the holiday bias is beginning,\" Emanuel said.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists, this past weekend, were among the latest to tweak their forecast for Fed rate hikes. They said there is now less than a 50 percent chance for a Fed rate hike in March, though they still see a 90 percent chance of a hike in December. They had previously forecast four hikes next year.\n\n\"The much more significant change is the sharp tightening in financial conditions. For a variety of reasons \u2014including an initial bout of concern about [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell's 'long way from neutral' remark, the inevitable slowing of GDP and profit growth from their exceptionally strong pace, and the broadening tension between the US and China \u2014 rising investor anxiety has pushed up our [financial conditions index] by about 80bp since early October. If the FCI remains constant at its current level, we estimate that tighter financial conditions would take \u00be-1pp off real GDP growth over the next year,\" the Goldman economists wrote.\n\nThe Goldman economists had expected the Fed to raise rates four times, including March, and have forecast that growth would fall below 2 percent in the second part of next year. They now say it's possible the Fed will change its rate hike forecast, expected to be released after its meeting next week.\n\nPowell was responsible for some of the change in tone after he said the Fed is close to neutral, contradicting a comment he made in early October that neutral is a long way off. Neutral is the level that would no longer be stimulative or slowing to the economy. A parade of Fed officials also sounded more dovish recently, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who has flagged slowing global growth as an issue.\n\n\"The Fed has been very sensitive to the elements of growth and the elements of weakness and vulnerability in our economy and the world economy,\" said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.\n\nStoltzfus said the market doesn't trust the Fed, however, and it continues to be a fear factor. \"There still is fear of the Fed. Some have said the honeymoon is over with Jay Powell. There never was a honeymoon as far as I'm concerned. The market didn't trust [Ben] Bernanke for his whole term, and he was good to them. It didn't trust Janet Yellen.

After removing artificial colors from Trix, General Mills poured them back in last year to bring back a \u201cclassic\u201d version in response to customer demand.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just processed and packaged foods that create illusions with colors.\n\nCHEESE\n\nBoar\u2019s Head, Cabot, Kraft, Tillamook. Check the packages of most cheddar cheeses, and they\u2019ll likely list an ingredient called annatto, a plant extract commonly used for color.\n\nThe practice reaches back to when cheesemakers in England skimmed the butterfat from milk to make butter, according to Elizabeth Chubbuck of Murray\u2019s Cheese in New York. The leftover milk was whiter, so cheesemakers added pigments to recreate butterfat\u2019s golden hue, she said.\n\nAnother cheese that sometimes gets cosmetic help: mozzarella.\n\nSara Burnett, director of food policy at Panera Bread, said mozzarella sometimes gets its bright white from titanium dioxide, a common ingredient derived from natural sources.\n\nWithout it, mozzarella would be beige or off-white.\n\nThe whitening is done because most U.S.-made mozzarella starts with cow\u2019s milk, which can have yellow hues, said Cathy Strange, global cheese buyer at Whole Foods.\n\nIn Italy, she said, mozzarella is traditionally made with water buffalo milk, which is whiter because the animal can\u2019t digest beta carotene.\n\nEGG YOLKS\n\nMany home cooks think darker egg yolks are fresher or more nutritious. But the color may be the result of marigold petals, alfalfa or coloring products in chicken feed.\n\nYolk color is primarily determined by the carotenoids \u2014 naturally occurring pigments in plants \u2014 that hens eat, according to Elizabeth Bobeck, a poultry nutrition professor at Iowa State University. It\u2019s easy to change yolk colors by simply altering hens\u2019 diet, she said.\n\nDarker yolks aren\u2019t necessarily healthier, Bobeck said. The belief that they are is likely rooted in the idea that yolks are darker when hens are fed a diet of fresh plants, which contain the pigments.\n\nMarc Dresner, a spokesman for the American Egg Board, said yolk colors varied more when chickens were fed whatever was available in the barnyard. Commercial feed has made yolk colors more consistent, but synthetic color additives are not allowed for chicken feed, Dresner said.\n\nBart Slaugh, a representative for Eggland\u2019s, noted mayonnaise and pasta makers may prefer paler yolks.\n\nSALMON\n\nBright pink flesh may signal freshness to shoppers eyeing salmon filets, which is why farmed salmon may have been fed synthetic astaxanthin, a version of a naturally occurring compound.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration notes that manufacturers have to declare on labeling if color additives were used for salmon. At Costco, farmed salmon is labeled with the disclosure \u201ccolor added through feed.\u201d\n\nIt may not sound appetizing, but manufacturers know the difference color can make.\n\nSalmon with a darker flesh can command an extra 50 cents to $1 per pound when offered side by side with lighter salmon, according to research by animal feed maker DSM.\n\nTo help producers size up the desirability of their salmon, the company offers a \u201dSalmoFan \u201d with varying shades of pink to help judge flesh colors.\n\nRepresentatives for DSM did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n___\n\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

First it was Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC ), then Cronos (NASDAQ: CRON ), and I think the next target is going to be Aphria (NYSE: APHA ) stock.\n\nStarting things off, alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) poured $4 billion into leading Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth back in August. That investment lit a fire under pot stocks as investors bid on who the next M&A target would be.\n\nThat enthusiasm waned over time. But, it\u2019s back now, and stronger than ever thanks to Marlboro cigarette maker Altria (NYSE: MO ) investing $1.8 billion into Canopy\u2019s peer, Cronos.\n\nNow, everyone is again bidding up pot stocks in an attempt to find the next M&A target, which leads us to Aphria. And there are four big reasons why I think lesser known Aphria stock is the next M&A target in the cannabis space.\n\nFirst, Aphria has a global and growing production and supply footprint for both medical and recreational marijuana, putting it on the same playing field as the Big Four pot stocks: Canopy, Cronos, Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY ) and Aurora (NYSE: ACB ). Second, the company has healthy financials, with industry-leading margins. Third, Aphria has huge production capacity. And fourth, Aphria stock has a market cap of just $1 billion, making it the cheapest notable Canadian pot stock.\n\nPut all those reasons together, and you have a strong case for Aphria stock as the next big M&A target in the cannabis industry.\n\nGlobal & Growing Footprint for Aphria Stock\n\nBig money is starting to flow into Canadian pot stocks. Part of the reason why is because cannabis is now legal across Canada, and big alcoholic beverage and tobacco companies are eager to get a piece of that pie. But, that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. In fact, it only tells a small piece of the story.\n\nThe Canadian cannabis market represents just a fraction of the global cannabis opportunity. According to Canopy Growth, the Canadian cannabis market accounts for around $10 billion of a $500 billion global opportunity.\n\nAs such, big money isn\u2019t moving into pot stocks for Canadian cannabis exposure. It\u2019s moving into pot stocks for global cannabis exposure. Just look at the two companies which have scored big investments thus far. Canopy Growth has production and supply agreements all across the globe. So does Cronos.\n\nAnd so does Aphria. The company has supply agreements throughout Canada, South America, Europe and Australia. Thus, much like other attractive cannabis M&A targets, Aphria has a truly global footprint that is only growing.\n\nHealthy Financials\n\nDespite being lesser known than other pot stocks, Aphria is characterized by strong financials which a potential suitor would find attractive.\n\nAt its core, this company has industry-average revenues, industry-leading revenue growth, and industry-leading gross margins. Last quarter, Aphria recorded just under $10 million in revenues. That is fairly middle-of-the-pack for the cannabis sector. Canopy and Aurora were up around $20 million to $30 million. Tilray was around $10 million. Cronos was down around $3 million.\n\nRevenue growth was more than 100%, which is at the top end of the group. Meanwhile, this is a company with normal gross margins in excess of 70%. That, too, is at the top end of the whole cannabis group.\n\nThe big takeaway here is that Aphria is at or near the top everywhere it matters in the cannabis sector except for raw revenue volume. But, that won\u2019t be a problem for long.\n\nHuge Production Capacity\n\nAphria is currently limited in its production capacity, with only 35,000 kilograms in annualized production capacity. But, this problem will be fixed shortly thanks to production expansion agreements.\n\nNext year, this company projects to have in excess of 250,000 kilograms in annualized production capacity. That number is huge. By comparison, Cronos has under 120,000 kilograms of production capacity. That is less than half of Aphria\u2019s planned production capacity, and they just scored a near $2 billion investment from a tobacco giant.\n\nAs such, this company\u2019s smaller revenue base won\u2019t be smaller for much longer. Once production capacity expands, revenues will start to explode higher. More importantly, this huge production base gives the company firepower to grow globally, and enough firepower to get big money to bite.\n\nRelatively Cheap Valuation\n\nPot stocks have big market caps. Both Canopy Growth and Tilray have market caps in the neighborhood of $10 billion. Aurora sports a $5 billion market cap. Cronos has a $2 billion market cap.\n\nCompared to its peers, Aphria is pretty cheap. Aphria\u2019s market cap is just a hair over $1 billion.\n\nThere really is no reason behind this big discount. Revenues are fairly standard. Revenue growth is industry leading. Gross margins are industry leading. The company has a global and growing footprint. Production capacity is projected to get really big, really soon.\n\nOverall, Aphria at $1 billion and other pot stocks at $2 billion to $10 billion doesn\u2019t make much sense. Clearly, big money believes in the $2 billion to $10 billion valuations for pot stocks because that is where Altria and Constellation Brands have poured in billions.\n\nAs such, I expect big money to take advantage of the under-valuation in Aphria stock.\n\nBottom Line on APHA Stock\n\nAphria stock, given its favorable fundamentals and discounted valuation, looks like the most likely pot stock to get a big money investment next. As such, buying the stock after its big sell-off but amid rising M&A activity in the cannabis space seems like a solid proposition.\n\nAs of this writing, Luke Lango was long CGC, CRON, and APHA.", "keywords": ["pot", "aphria", "target", "market", "growth", "ma", "billion", "reasons", "stocks", "company", "production", "stock", "big", "cannabis"], "summary": "That investment lit a fire under pot stocks as investors bid on who the next M&A target would be.\nNow, everyone is again bidding up pot stocks in an attempt to find the next M&A target, which leads us to Aphria.\nAnd there are four big reasons why I think lesser known Aphria stock is the next M&A target in the cannabis space.\nPut all those reasons together, and you have a strong case for Aphria stock as the next big M&A target in the cannabis industry.\nHealthy FinancialsDespite being lesser known than other pot stocks, Aphria is characterized by strong financials which a potential suitor would find attractive."}, {"link": "https://news.crunchbase.com/news/uber-follows-lyfts-lead-by-filing-draft-ipo-paperwork-with-sec/", "published": "2018-12-10T15:51:22", "title": "Uber Follows Lyft\u2019s Lead By Filing Draft IPO Paperwork With SEC", "author": ["Jason D. Rowley", "Mary Ann Azevedo"], "text": "Last Thursday must have been a busy day for someone at the SEC. Sources confirmed with the Wall Street Journal and New York Times that Uber Technologies Inc. (better known simply as Uber) confidentially filed preliminary paperwork on December 6th to list its shares on the open market in an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nFollow Crunchbase News on Twitter\n\nThat would bring that day\u2019s count of IPO filings by U.S. ride-hailing giants to two. Recall that Lyft also filed with the SEC that day. Reports indicate that both Uber and Lyft filed draft paperwork with the SEC, which can remain confidential until terms of the transaction are fully spelled out. Over the weekend, Crunchbase News spoke with two people at Uber concerning its IPO date, and both sources cited the second half of 2019 as the current timeline.\n\nUber holds a number of distinctions in the world of Silicon Valley startups. With over $15.91 billion raised to date (including $3.15 billion in cumulative debt offerings), Uber has raised more money than any other U.S. startup, ever. The chart below, originally published by Crunchbase News last month, shows just how much money Uber has raised over time.\n\nThe only two companies to raise more cumulative capital are based in China. Ant Financial has raised $18.5 billion to date. Uber\u2019s principal Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, has raised over $17 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase data. Uber sold its China unit (Uber China) to Didi in 2016 in a deal that valued the combined company at $35 billion.\n\nUber is also the most valuable U.S. startup to date. (Its place atop global valuation ranks was usurped by China-based Bytedance in October.) The company\u2019s most recent valuation\u2014as of late August 2018\u2014was approximately $72 billion, post-money. That transaction closed $500 million in funding from Toyota Motor Corporation, reportedly to finance self-driving car efforts.\n\nIn October, our EIC Alex Wilhelm wrote about how an Uber IPO could value the company at more than $120 billion (according to bankers) compared to an estimated valuation of $15 billion for its chief rival, Lyft. That Uber valuation was a much higher figure than the figure above. This is a company that lost $1.375 billion in the first half of 2018 and $1.07 billion in the third quarter alone.\n\nAlex also pointed out that both companies are \u201cdeeply unprofitable,\u201d with Lyft being even more unprofitable than Uber at least on a percent-of-revenue basis.\n\nHere\u2019s some Uber financials from the first half of the year that Alex put together:\n\nH1\u201918 revenue: $5.4 billion.\n\nH1\u201918 revenue growth from H1\u201917: 66.6 percent.\n\nH1\u201918 net loss: $1.375 billion.1\n\nNet margin: -25.5 percent.\n\nIn the third quarter, Uber\u2019s revenue totaled $2.95 billion. This was 38 percent greater than its year-ago result, but overall\u2014as Alex wrote\u2014revenue growth fell from over 8 percent on a sequential-quarter basis to 5 percent in the third quarter.\n\nSo, thinking about an IPO with those numbers does give one pause. But it looks like Uber\u2019s forging ahead. As we mentioned last week, it feels like Uber and Lyft have been in a race to the public markets because how one prices and performs will almost certainly influence the other\u2019s pricing and performance.\n\nIllustration: Li-Anne Dias", "keywords": ["raised", "lyft", "ubers", "ipo", "draft", "crunchbase", "sec", "billion", "valuation", "paperwork", "date", "follows", "uber", "lead", "lyfts", "filing"], "summary": "Reports indicate that both Uber and Lyft filed draft paperwork with the SEC, which can remain confidential until terms of the transaction are fully spelled out.\nOver the weekend, Crunchbase News spoke with two people at Uber concerning its IPO date, and both sources cited the second half of 2019 as the current timeline.\nWith over $15.91 billion raised to date (including $3.15 billion in cumulative debt offerings), Uber has raised more money than any other U.S. startup, ever.\nThe chart below, originally published by Crunchbase News last month, shows just how much money Uber has raised over time.\nThat Uber valuation was a much higher figure than the figure above."}, {"link": "https://wgem.com/2018/12/10/83326/", "published": "2018-12-10T11:58:59", "title": "Arrests made after Christmas donations stolen", "author": ["Natalie Will"], "text": "Quincy police early Monday morning announced arrested linked to Christmas donations stolen from the Salvation Army.\n\nOfficers said three male juveniles were arrested around 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThey were charged with burglary, criminal trespass to state supported land and criminal damage.\n\nOfficers say the three boys broke into the old Washington Elementary School building on 8th Street where the items were kept on December 2 and December 6 and took the items.\n\nAccording to the police report the investigation continues and further charges against additional suspects are possible.", "keywords": ["took", "supported", "arrested", "sundaythey", "suspects", "trespass", "criminal", "washington", "street", "christmas", "arrests", "stolen", "donations"], "summary": "Quincy police early Monday morning announced arrested linked to Christmas donations stolen from the Salvation Army.\nOfficers said three male juveniles were arrested around 5 p.m. Sunday.\nThey were charged with burglary, criminal trespass to state supported land and criminal damage.\nOfficers say the three boys broke into the old Washington Elementary School building on 8th Street where the items were kept on December 2 and December 6 and took the items.\nAccording to the police report the investigation continues and further charges against additional suspects are possible."}, {"link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/12/11/older-headlights-safety-concern-aaa-says/2263336002/", "published": "2018-12-11T05:01:00", "title": "Why older headlights are a 'major safety concern' for American motorists", "author": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published A.M.

Most importantly, we believe the long history at Roche makes him a choice that isn\u2019t likely to break an already good company. While we expect that replacing the head of one of the strongest management teams ever seen in biotech to be a challenging role, we think that O\u2019Day is highly qualified and should ease investor concerns leading into Milligan\u2019s retirement.\n\nWhile investors keenly await a strategic plan and vision from O\u2019Day, analysts at Jefferies laid out a possible scenario:\n\nWe believe O\u2019Day will look to develop a strategy over the course of 2019 and it will include a view on deploying GILD\u2019s current cash of ~$32B towards more oncology assets and other key areas, such as inflammation and liver diseases. Note\u2019s GILD\u2019s current debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at roughly ~2.6x so the company could still lever up to do more deals. (\u2026) we can assume his plan-of-action for 2019 is to ensure that: (1) HCV stabilizes and becomes more \u201cpredictable\u201d, (2) HIV grows as Biktarvy continues to reach record revenues, and (3) Yescarta grows each quarter as the company continues to expand its presence in hematology (e.g. allogeneic CAR-T) and solid tumors (neo-antigens).\n\nFaced with a waning hep C franchise, Gilead has swallowed Kite Pharma in a bid to become a leader in CAR-T, snapping up new technologies along the way. It is now up to O\u2019Day to galvanize the sales of Kite\u2019s CAR-T therapy Yescarta, which despite impressive survival rates generated a paltry $183 million for the first nine months of 2018.\n\nMeanwhile in Basel, Genentech CEO Bill Anderson will fill O\u2019Day\u2019s shoes.\n\nImage: Daniel O\u2019Day.

In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Tech, analyst Dylan Lewis and Fool.com contributor Evan Niu focus on Lyft and Uber specifically.

Furthermore, what are the big-picture plans for these companies, and how feasible are they really? Tune in to hear more.\n\nAlso, the duo look at the wearables and virtual/artificial reality markets. Some recent data from IDC gives investors a snapshot of where both markets are today -- the biggest players, trends, growth, and more.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on Dec. 7, 2018.\n\nDylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, December 7th, and we're talking IPO and IDC. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis. I'm joined on Skype by senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, what's going on?\n\nEvan Niu: Not much. We have a holiday party going on this weekend. Going to have some friends over. That should be fun.\n\nLewis: I, too, am having a holiday party this weekend! Look at that! I think it's just early enough in December that it's not too close to all the real craziness of the holidays, so everyone's like, \"We'll do the friend stuff this weekend.\"\n\nNiu: It's that time of the year.\n\nLewis: It's that time of the year. What's on the agenda for you guys? What are you going to be doing?\n\nNiu: Nothing too much, just hanging out. Open-house, people can come by as they want whenever they're free. Pretty chill.\n\nLewis: Got it. I'm doing something similar. We're going to do a little movie kind of thing early on in the day, get in the spirit, then decorate the tree that I have gotten with my roommates. Our non-denominational holiday tree, because we are a mixed household. I'm excited for that. I'm excited to have some eggnog.\n\nI'm also excited, Evan, because we're getting the first inklings of a Lyft IPO thanks to some news that came out earlier this week.\n\nNiu: That's right. It's funny, Lyft publicly announced that they made a confidential filing [laughs] with the SEC. They've now filed their S-1 registration statement with the SEC on a confidential basis. It's really the first step toward an IPO, which is probably going to come in early 2019 at this point.\n\nLewis: Yeah. This is notable for a couple different reasons. This is a company that has been private for quite some time. It's one of those unicorns that people have been watching for a while. They're also beating their competitor Uber to the public markets with this timeline, if it holds. We're seeing the confidential filing being used. Again, this is something investors have seen more and more of.\n\nLet's unpack some of that. It seemed pretty clear that Uber would be going public at some point in 2019. They also have some incentives to go public based on some of the deals that they've structured with SoftBank.\n\nNiu: Right. Lyft at this point being likely to go public first is meaningful, because not only are they upstaging Uber, but there's quite a bit of investor demand to get into this ride hailing space, and it's really just Uber and Lyft as the main ride hailing companies if you exclude, before we talked about Waymo and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). As far as pure plays go, it's really Uber and Lyft. And I think there's quite a bit of pent up investor demand and interest in this space. Whoever can get out there first might be able to capitalize on some of that pent-up demand being let loose, and investors for the first time having a chance to get into this space.\n\nLewis: And as the smaller player, too. Lyft is that clear No. 2 in ride hailing. They're about a fifth of the size of Uber. For them to go public, enjoy all the name recognition that comes with that, all of the PR, all the press, that might help with some adoption here in the U.S. and Canada, where they compete with Uber, and really help them close the gap. They have a long ways to go to make that happen, but I have to imagine going public will help a bit.\n\nNiu: Absolutely, in terms of brand awareness, you're absolutely right. Uber is much more prominent in more markets around the world. As you mentioned, they're a lot bigger. Lyft is really just in the U.S. and Canada. They don't have a lot of brand recognition outside of North America. So, this will probably raise that awareness a little bit.\n\nLewis: Unfortunately, we are kind of grasping at straws for what Lyft's financials look like. Details are a bit scarce right now. You mentioned this confidential filing. A lot of people probably don't understand what that means and why companies are allowed to do this. So, just as a little primer, and something that you can stow away, because you're going to see this more and more -- confidential filings are a relatively new thing. It was something that was opened up as part of the Obama-era JOBS Act. Ideally, it was supposed to be used for small companies, ones that have less than $1 billion in revenue, to confidentially file a draft registration with the SEC months and months before going public. The idea there is, they wouldn't be opening up their books to public scrutiny before deciding to go public and making that step. Once they did that, all the paperwork would become available 15 days before the company would begin its IPO roadshow.\n\nLike I said, this started with small companies as part of the JOBS Act. Mid-2017, the SEC decided, \"We're going to eliminate that cap on $1 billion in revenue.\" And you're seeing all these larger companies doing that now.\n\nNiu: Right. I think Lyft certainly qualifies in there. They're above $1 billion in annual revenue. They're taking full advantage of that.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And when you're in a space where you have such a clear competitor in Uber, it totally makes sense that you don't want to have to show them your books and your key business metrics.\n\nNiu: Right. For private companies, keeping the books kind of under wraps is pretty important, particularly when you talk about this type of competitive space.\n\nLewis: Big picture, the confidential filing is not a shady thing. This is something that was passed, like I said, during the Obama administration as a pro-business thing, making it a little bit easier, a little bit less intimidating, for small companies to wade into the pool of going public, and starting to have those conversations with the SEC. Now, I mean, is it great for investor transparency? Not necessarily. I think ultimately, the companies that do wind up going public will wind up providing all the necessary paperwork, and people are going to be getting it well ahead of when the companies start their roadshow and start approaching investors anyways. It's a timing thing more than anything else. You'd like to have the information, of course, but it isn't anything to be too concerned with.\n\nNiu: Right. The timing of this is important, too. When they first passed the JOBS Act, it was 2012. With that $1 billion limit, the goal was to basically get these start-ups to consider going public more. Startups are an important part of the economy, they have a lot of jobs. But, I think what they didn't foresee was the age of the unicorns sprouting that we've seen in recent years, where you have all these companies that are becoming quite large but staying private. I think that's the context of why they've changed this limit to allow these larger companies to take advantage of the confidential process, like you mentioned.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And looking at the slate of potential 2019 and 2020 IPOs, we're just going to see more and more of this. There's Uber, Lyft, Palantir, Airbnb. There are a ton of really big, highly coveted private companies out there now that are probably considering an IPO at some point soon. Investors, you're going to see this confidential filing come up again. That's what it means.\n\nIn talking about this in prepping for the show, I threw out there on Twitter that we were going to be talking about the Lyft IPO and was curious if anyone had any questions. We have one from listener Austin. He asks, \"Not sure anyone saw the Lyft IPO happening before Uber. Which company is the better company?\" Evan, we might think that they're kind of synonymous because a lot of people use them interchangeably. But these are two totally different companies.\n\nNiu: Right. Not only in terms of size, but there are also some pretty big strategic differences, particularly with how they're approaching autonomous driving over the past year. Uber has had such a tumultuous experience with trying to develop self-driving cars. They had this whole trade secret thing where they reportedly hired a Google engineer and he stole a bunch of stuff, and they had one lady die from one of their autonomous cars. So, they really pulled back quite a bit on their investments in self-driving vehicles. Whereas Lyft is trying to expand more into it and keeps pushing more and more. That's going to be a pretty core differentiator long-term -- I mean, super-long-term, because we're nowhere near close to actually having self-driving cars.\n\nLewis: It's a key element to the long-term thesis for both of these companies. We don't have a ton to go on here, in terms of company financials, to do an apples-to-apples comparison. If you want some of the highlights, though, you can look and see, Uber is international, they're in over 60 countries. Lyft is focused in the U.S. and Canada. Uber has some other businesses. They also do Uber Eats and they have a freight business. Lyft is pretty much focused on ride hailing and some of the micro mobility stuff that John Rosevear and Nick Sciple were actually talking on yesterday's show. If you want a little primer on that space, definitely check that out.\n\nUber also has some brand baggage associated with it. They've moved away from the Travis Kalanick era, where there were a lot of problems with the corporate culture there, some of the things you mentioned with the corporate espionage with Google. Lyft doesn't have that. Lyft is like this nice soft and fuzzy brand. [laughs]\n\nNiu: Right. I mean, I'm not a big user of ride hailing services in general because I live in the suburbs, but I will say that in general, my wife and I absolutely refuse to use Uber whatsoever, even when we're travelling and when we need to use ride hailing locally, specifically because of that brand baggage that you mentioned. Their internal culture and ethics under Kalanick were just so horrendous, in terms of just the cutthroat things they would do with competitors, their internal culture with women, the misogyny, there's a whole long list of things that's not worth covering right now since it's so long. [laughs] But, I personally will not use Uber. I'll use Lyft, and we'll use Lyft whenever we need to. But, speaking of brand baggage, we just don't use it.\n\nLewis: There are, though, plenty of people that are happy to use Uber. There are a lot of people that look at the price and say, \"What's the better price? What's the better fare?\" Some context around what we do know for the books of these two companies: Uber did $2.7 billion in revenue in Q2 of 2018, which is up 51% year over year. They're posting adjusted EBITDA losses of around $400 million on that revenue. Lyft, in the first half of 2018, did somewhere in the neighborhood of $900 million in revenue, up 120% year over year, and posted a net loss of $370 million on that. Neither of these businesses are profitable. Both are growing very quickly. Those growth rates and the revenue bases really speak to the size of these two companies. It's kind of a Coke and Pepsi dynamic.\n\nNiu: Right. That's one thing that jumps out to me, is how much money these companies lose for operating a fairly capital-light business. They're just operating a platform. I've always looked at ride hailing in its current state, it's kind of like it's subsidized by venture capitalists, because they offer these rides for so cheap that are below cost, which is why they had to raise so much money. Uber has raised $25 billion over 21 rounds. Lyft has raised like $5 billion. These companies just devour so much capital. And it's kind of hard to justify why. Of course, if you're investing in autonomous cars and stuff, that makes sense. But even the core operations ... we'll get more detail whenever they actually start showing us the books, but my sense is, they're still losing a lot of money up front.\n\nLewis: Yeah. I think Austin will get his more responsible and direct answer from us down the road when we can really look at both of these companies. What I will say, though, is that the future is so dependent on autonomous vehicles for both of them. The idea that they can dramatically bring their cost structure down by having a fleet of autonomous vehicles and not having to pay drivers makes the numbers look a lot better for this kind of business. You think, OK, there might be a relatively easy path to that. But, no. This is an incredibly competitive space. Just as a case in point for that, Alphabet's driverless car company Waymo announced Waymo One this week. This is a commercial ride hailing service. They're piloting it in the Phoenix metro area. And rides are going to be carried out with a safety driver, but this is another step toward self-driving cars taking hold. And Alphabet is not a company that needs to win self-driving cars to have their future work out. They have way more money than Uber or Lyft possibly can, and they're beating both of them to market in autonomy.\n\nNiu: Right. Longer-term, it's just so uncertain who's going to actually get to full autonomy first, like level five autonomy because it's such a tough challenge to tackle from a technical standpoint. Some companies use LIDAR. Most companies use LIDAR, but some are trying without LIDAR. It's not clear yet what approach is actually going to get people there first. Then, on top of that, then you have to turn around, look at how you're going to actually create a business model out of it.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And then, GM is in there with Cruise; Ford has its own mobility play. It's a crowded space. You have a lot of players with a lot of different incentives. Like you say, whoever cracks autonomy first is going to be the one who drives the way this industry goes. It's a hard business either way. You'll get more details from us as we get the company financials. But, if you do nothing else, if you're not an Alphabet shareholder, that's a pretty easy way to access this market. And, you have the backing of a rock-solid monopoly to throw off cash while they invest in this kind of stuff. As an Alphabet shareholder, I'm happy to say, if this winds up becoming something that contributes to an already-strong ad business, awesome, because they're the leader in this space right now.\n\nNiu: Right. We're just going to have to wait and see. I'm personally not interested in either Lyft or Uber because of everything we just mentioned. But it'll be interesting to look through the numbers when they finally give us some.\n\nLewis: Yeah, I cannot wait. Unfortunately, we're going to have to wait until 2019.\n\nEvan, not to be outdone on the news front, we have some fresh data from market research firm IDC on wearables and VR. I really love checking these out. I think it's a great at-a-glance for what's going on in the consumer tech space. This firm does such a good job giving people the 5,000-foot view.\n\nNiu: These are really exciting markets in general. Getting this data on these estimates and how it's going is a really useful tool for investors to see, when they're looking at their investments in companies that are playing in and participating in these markets. Wearables is a particularly fun one since wearable tech is a nascent category that's still on the up and up.\n\nWhat we saw in the third quarter was that basic trackers returned to growth. You know, the Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) kind of fitness trackers. That was thanks largely to new product launches in emerging markets. Basic trackers are still pretty popular in emerging markets because they're more affordable. The U.S. market was actually flat in the third quarter because that market is already transitioning from first-time purchases toward your placements and upgrades -- actually, in my opinion, sooner than I would have expected.\n\nLewis: One of my favorite things in looking at these reports, though, is who's moving where in terms of market share? We can see the competitive landscape. That's always fun. What did you see there?\n\nNiu: This quarter, we saw Xiaomi (NASDAQOTH:XIACF) reclaim No. 1. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had been No. 1 for the past two quarters thanks to its Apple Watch, but Xiaomi's Mi Band 3, which is a basic tracker, has been selling really well, so they were able to actually take No. 1 in the third quarter.\n\nIf you look at smartwatches specifically, and you exclude basic trackers, Apple is still No. 1. In terms of the Apple Watch, they launched the Series 4 at the very end of the quarter. So, they only had about 10 days left to the quarter when Apple Watch 4 launched. They also discounted Apple Watch 3. Actually, that lower price point has also been helping drive demand and drive unit volumes. Series 3, expectedly, was the majority of units. But, according to IDC's estimates, the Series 4 was actually almost 20% of unit volumes in just 10 days. That shows how strong the demand for Series 4 was at launch.\n\nLewis: That's pretty incredible. We can't talk about the wearables space without also talking about Fitbit. We've given Apple Watch its time. What's going on with Fitbit in this report?\n\nNiu: Fitbit has become the No. 2 player primarily with its Versa smartwatch, which is much more approachable, it's a little bit cheaper. That's what we've seen play out over the past couple of quarters. You and I have covered their earnings a couple of times. We've seen this coming. The good news for Fitbit is, the IDC expects them to keep that No. 2 status in the smartwatch market, mostly because, as we mentioned in previous shows, Android Wear OS is not competitive. No one's really buying those devices. The market still wants some alternative to the Apple Watch, and Fitbit has stepped up to provide it.\n\nLewis: Yeah. It's probably good for consumers to have a couple different options out there. It's nice to have some competition, nice to have a little bit of a push on the feature side so they keep innovating.\n\nNiu: The big thing that IDC points out is that healthcare is really becoming a core part of this market. Apple and Fitbit are both really pushing toward these digital health platforms in their own different ways. Now, who gets there first, and who can really build the most robust platform is an open question. It remains to be seen. But, certainly, Apple has a lot more money to invest in building it. That's going to be a big thing to watch going forward, is the underlying platform of these devices.\n\nLewis: Thinking about this market, though, you have the low-end and the high-end. It sounds like any hardware profits are going to be made on the smartwatch side. Market share gains are going to be happening with the cheaper end of the market. How do those factor into the health solutions that these folks are looking for? Is it that, if we want to track who's going to have the better health platform, we should be looking at the high-end smartwatch sales?\n\nNiu: The basic trackers are just so limited in the amount of data they can collect. The value that people are putting into the actual platform will also determine what kind of device they're interested in. If you look longer-term, smartwatch prices have been coming down quite a bit. Apple does this thing, and they've been using the same strategy for the iPhone for many years, where they extend the overall lifecycle of a product by selling the same product over years and years, but they just lower the price over time. As those prices keep coming down, the difference between going out and buying a basic tracker or buying a smartwatch, even if it's a previous generation smartwatch, will keep getting smaller and smaller. And as that gap shrinks, more and more people will be willing to make the move up-market into a smartwatch that is more capable, can do a lot more things, can collect more health data, and give you more value out of those health platforms.\n\nLewis: Yeah, it doesn't feel like as much of an upfront investment, right?\n\nNiu: Exactly. Especially if the difference is small. If the difference between a basic tracker and a smartwatch is $20 or $50, which one would you pick?\n\nLewis: Right. [laughs] I think upfront investment might be the perfect way to segue into the VR and AR discussion. This is a market where I think a lot of people have been very excited for a very long time. It's a sexy idea, the idea of virtual reality. The reality of virtual reality is, a lot of the rigs are expensive, and a lot of the computing needs to power this stuff are also fairly expensive. What does adoption look like there? What did you glean from the report?\n\nNiu: People like thinking about VR because it's so sci-fi. [laughs] The VR market has been declining for about four consecutive quarters. It finally returned to growth in the third quarter, according to IDC's numbers, with 8% growth. There were 1.9 million units sold worldwide. Kind of like we're seeing in the wearables market, the falling prices and the discounts are really helping to spur unit volumes in both consumer and enterprise markets because it makes it cheaper for people to give it a try.\n\nLewis: In the wearables market, we have the very limited functionality bands, and then we have the smartwatches. In VR, we have screenless viewers, tethered headsets, stand-alone headsets. What's going on within those spaces?\n\nNiu: Screenless viewers, which are those accessories where you strap a phone to your face, which is kind of not a great experience, those volumes are getting crushed. Those volumes are down 60%, almost. I don't think that's too surprising because those products have never been that compelling to begin with. It's just a really cheap way for users to explore a really rudimentary VR experience. There's also not a lot of potential for innovation because it's just accessory, whereas the phone itself is the primary device to delivering the VR. Companies aren't working too hard on this category, so it's not too surprising to see the volumes dropping here.\n\nLewis: I've always thought of it as the gateway to VR. Maybe it's the first way that some people experience any VR interaction. You have the Google Cardboard-type product, where you pop it in, it costs like $10 or something like that. I remember being at trade shows, and people literally gave them away as a way to build brand buzz and things like that. But you're like, \"Oh, this is neat,\" and then it collects dust on your desk for a year. So, I can see why that category might be getting crushed.\n\nWhat about some of the more involved stuff?\n\nNiu: The tethered headsets, which are the ones where you have the headset, but you still have to plug into a high-powered PC, that market is still pretty solid. Sold over a million units for the second time ever. Sony is the clear leader with the PSVR. They sold almost 500,000 units. They have a pretty big advantage here because they've sold over 80 million PS4 gaming consoles to date. That's a pretty large installed base of people that already have the big hardware that you need. Then, the PSVR is a small accessory that you buy on top of that Whereas, compared to PC-based virtual reality, like Facebook's Oculus Rift, the Rift itself is kind of expensive, but also, you need to buy a gaming PC that's $800 or more. That's a pretty expensive setup. There's clearly a market for it of enthusiasts that are really big into it. Most of the applications are still gaming. That market is still doing pretty solid.\n\nLewis: That's kind of funny, because Oculus is the Kleenex of VR. I think if you were to ask someone to name a VR rig, that would be the one that they'd throw out there.\n\nNiu: They're No. 2. They sold about 300,000 units in the quarter. They're second behind Sony. No. 3 is HTC. Three main players here.\n\nLewis: Something that I was surprised by looking at this report is how AR hasn't taken the way that I was hoping it might. I look at VR and I say, it's immersive, it's wholly immersive. AR is a hybrid there. And yet, it is still a very small portion of the market of this combined AR-VR space.\n\nNiu: Right. AR is still only about 3% of the market. Kind of like the early VR stuff we were talking about with the accessories, AR primarily is being delivered through phones these days. You have Apple and Google really pushing AR technology on their own platforms to allow developers to create these experiences that are all through your phone. You use your phone as a viewfinder. As far as pure AR headsets go, there aren't a lot of players. It's really Lenovo and Microsoft. Lenovo sells this one headset that's very limited, there's just one Star Wars game. Microsoft has its HoloLens, which there's been a lot of buzz around, but it's still only available to developers, and it costs $3,000. [laughs]\n\nLonger-term, Facebook and Apple are reportedly working on these dedicated AR headsets. As we've talked about before, Tim Cook has talked about the potential for augmented reality extensively. He really thinks it's a game-changing technology. We know that Apple's investing heavily in it, we just don't know when they're going to do something.\n\nLewis: Your point about AR, and that headset costing $3,000, that's been the struggle with this category in general. It's expensive, and people don't necessarily want to lay out that kind of money for something that the content isn't there yet for. The entertainment experience isn't quite there yet. Think about how many things you drop several thousand dollars on to just purely enjoy. Maybe a TV every couple years. I've long held the idea that the real, most visible adoption of AR is going to happen with phones. And it hasn't really happened in a way that's all that functional or all that helpful yet. Most of the AR experiences that people have on phones are emojis or filters on Snap. They aren't these really helpful at-a-glances, or layers onto whatever you're looking at that can help you make sense of something.\n\nNiu: Right. Of course, you have to mention Google Glass from years ago, which was just so ahead of its time. Yeah, I definitely agree that the really killer use cases aren't there yet. But that being said, I think it's really exciting if you look at some of the stuff that these developers are making. I saw one the other day, there was a photo-realistic shoe -- some product demo-type thing. But it looked photorealistic. It was kind of crazy how good it looked. There's a lot of these glimpses that we're seeing of what developers are working on that do have a lot of promise and potential for the future. But, I definitely agree that it's not quite there yet, to the point where it would warrant someone buying a dedicated AR headset for everyday use. It's just not there yet.\n\nLewis: To recap all of this, it sounds like Sony is continuing to do what it needs to do to further VR in the gaming space. For some of the other big tech names, expect AR and maybe some idea of VR to play into hardware that people maybe already have, or to future product lines. But a company like Apple, this isn't playing into the strategy in a very visible way right now.\n\nNiu: Right. But they're laying the groundwork for it eventually. They're doing the right thing with getting the content and getting people used to the idea first, which paves the way for eventual adoption of a dedicated headset later on.\n\nLewis: Do you think that we will see something AR or VR-related from Apple before we see Uber and Lyft go public, Evan?\n\nNiu: [laughs] No. I think it'll probably be three to five years or so. Definitely not 2019, would not expect that.\n\nLewis: I guess we'll just have to keep waiting. That's just the way things go.

It makes recommendations about ways that Congress, federal agencies and private companies can prevent future hacks, including moving away from Social Security numbers as the prime way to authenticate a person\u2019s identity and studying ways to mitigate security risks.\n\nBut much like everything Congress does, the analysis is not without controversy.\n\nThe investigation was largely bipartisan, but the committee\u2019s top Democrat, U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said the final report did not incorporate suggestions from Democrats to prevent future breaches. And Equifax itself said it identified \u201csignificant inaccuracies\u201d with the report\u2019s factual findings, even as it said it agreed with many of its recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that the Committee chose not to provide us with adequate time to review and respond to a 100-page report consisting of highly technical and important information,\u201d company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said. \u201cDuring the few hours we were given to conduct a preliminary review we identified significant inaccuracies and disagree with many of the factual findings.\u201d\n\n\u2018Failure to implement\u2019\n\nEquifax is a key cog in the global financial system, collecting consumer data such as Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers and birthdates to help lenders verify a person\u2019s identity and decide whether he or she is credit-worthy.\n\nThe sensitive nature of that information is what made the news so dire when the company announced in September 2017 that a security flaw allowed hackers to access the data of more than half of American adults from mid-May through the end of July last year, when the company discovered the breach.\n\nThe investigative report echoed testimony before Congress last year finding that Equifax was warned about the flaw in March 2017, but the company failed to make the fix before hackers could infiltrate the company\u2019s systems.\n\nThe new House Oversight report said two main internal factors allowed the breach to occur.\n\nFirst, it said the company grew too rapidly. As Equifax accelerated its acquisitions of smaller firms beginning in 2005, it couldn\u2019t merge and streamline its information technology security programs fast enough, the report states.\n\nSecond, the structure of the Equifax\u2019s IT department allowed for a \u201clack of accountability and no clear lines of authority.\u201d The chaos led to the company allowing more than 300 security certificates to expire, with one critical vulnerability going unpatched for 145 days.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s failure to implement basic security protocols, including file integrity monitoring and network segmentation, allowed the attackers to access and remove large amounts of data,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe House Oversight panel also blamed Equifax for being wildly unprepared once it informed the public of the breach. A new website and 1,500-person call center were immediately overwhelmed, and employees were not properly trained to help consumers protect their identity. And the company\u2019s Twitter account directed consumers to a phishing website for nearly two weeks before being fixed.\n\nConsumer advocates have warned that victims could potentially be at risk for years because the pilfered information could be used to impersonate consumers and wreck their finances.\n\nNew recommendations\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to prevent future hacks, even as it did little to implicate Congress for failing to pass cybersecurity legislation before or after the breach.\n\nThe document said lawmakers should review the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to punish businesses for making false or misleading claims about security or failing to take reasonable preventive measures. It also calls on the executive branch to make recommendations to Congress about identification protection services and to work with the private sector to mitigate cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn a separate report, Democrats called on Congress to pass a comprehensive law governing how and when the victims of data breaches should be notified and give the FTC power to levy stricter civil penalties when companies violate consumer data security rules.\n\nEquifax\u2019s Hawkins said the company was \u201cgenerally supportive\u201d of many of the recommendations in the GOP report and that it has already \u201cmade significant strides in many of these areas.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the incident, Equifax has moved forward, taking meaningful steps to enhance our technology and security programs and will continue to focus on consumers, customers and regaining trust with all stakeholders,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nBut the tone of Equifax\u2019s response did not satisfy Liz Coyle, the executive director of the consumer advocacy group Georgia Watch.\n\n\u201cThe tone was very much that Equifax was a victim, and that is just not the case,\u201d she said. \u201cEquifax uses consumer data to make money.\u201d\n\nPaul Stephens, the director of policy and advocacy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in California, commended Congress for \u201cnot trying to sweep it under the rug.\u201d But he also said Congress has utterly failed to pass meaningful legislation \u2014 with steep financial penalties \u2014 to hold companies accountable for data security.\n\n\u201cYou need to create financial incentives either through penalties or other tactics to dissuade companies from being sloppy with personal data in the future,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThere need to be standards and companies need to be held accountable if they don\u2019t meet those standards.\u201d\n\nCoyle agreed, even as she said she agreed with some of the House Oversight panel\u2019s specific recommendations on issues such as Social Security numbers.\n\nAfter the breach\n\nIn addition to the congressional probe, a coalition of state attorneys general, including Georgia\u2019s Chris Carr, launched an investigation into the hacking. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Atlanta is also leading a federal criminal probe into the breach as well as a criminal investigation into allegations of insider trading by Equifax employees.\n\nTwo former Equifax employees were indicted on securities fraud charges earlier this year, and one pleaded guilty to trading his shares before the hacking was made public.\n\nThe breach led to the downfall of then-CEO Rick Smith, who over his tenure transformed the company from a pure credit bureau into a mammoth data analysis machine. Other senior executives also left the company, including the chief information and chief security officers at the time of the breach.\n\nIn the more than 14 months since the breach was disclosed, Equifax has also hired cybersecurity consultants and beefed up its data protections.\n\nThe company also cleaned house, appointing a new executive leadership team.\n\nBut mostly, Equifax has plowed ahead.\n\nThe company reported $2.6 billion in revenue and $274.2 million in profit through the first nine months of 2018.\n\nIn 2017, the company reported $113.3 million in pretax costs related to the hacking, and tens of millions more in costs related to providing a suite of credit protection services to consumers affected by the breach, according to securities filings.\n\nEquifax said in its latest quarterly filing that it expects \u201cto incur significant professional services expenses associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident in future periods,\u201d as well as costs related to technology and security improvements.", "keywords": ["congress", "report", "consumers", "2017", "data", "slams", "information", "congressional", "company", "security", "breach", "companies", "equifax"], "summary": "\u201cEquifax failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks,\u201d the 96-page report states.\nAs Equifax accelerated its acquisitions of smaller firms beginning in 2005, it couldn\u2019t merge and streamline its information technology security programs fast enough, the report states.\nThe House Oversight panel also blamed Equifax for being wildly unprepared once it informed the public of the breach.\nOther senior executives also left the company, including the chief information and chief security officers at the time of the breach.\nIn the more than 14 months since the breach was disclosed, Equifax has also hired cybersecurity consultants and beefed up its data protections."}, {"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-state-is-the-most-burdened-by-credit-card-debt-2018-12-10", "published": "2018-12-10T20:04:00", "title": "This state is the most burdened by credit-card debt", "author": ["Jacob Passy"], "text": "Where you live in the United States makes a difference when it comes to paying off credit card debt.\n\nIt takes the average New Mexico household nearly twice as long to pay off their credit-card debt as it does households in Massachusetts, according to a new report from CreditCards.com. New Mexico had the highest credit-card burden of all 50 states, while Massachusetts had the lowest.\n\nThe disparity comes down to the relationship between debt and income, CreditCards.com industry analyst Ted Rossman said in the report. \u201cThe states where residents owe the most on their credit cards (Alaska, Virginia, Texas, Maryland and Connecticut) do not rank among the five highest debt burdens because their median household incomes are higher,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem for people who live in New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas isn\u2019t just how much they owe, it\u2019s compounded by how low their incomes are by comparison.\u201d\n\nIn New Mexico, a household earning the median annual income of $46,744 would take nearly 1.5 years to pay off the state\u2019s average household credit card balance of $8,323.

Hart Van Denburg/CPR News\n\nColorado\u2019s economy is expected to add more than 53,000 jobs in 2019. University of Colorado economists forecast growth across all sectors and that the state will rank tops in other key economic measures.\n\nIn other words, the winning streak should continue, despite recent spasms in the stock market.\n\n\u201cNobody has a recession in 2019,\u201d stated Richard Wobbekind a professor at the CU Boulder\u2019s Leeds School of Business. \u201cThe stock market seems to be on its own.\u201d\n\nWhile next year is expected to be sunny, there are storm clouds on the horizon. Barring some unforeseen circumstance, many expect a recession in 2020 or even 2021.\n\nThe Fight For Workers\n\nJobs are expected to grow 2 percent in the new year. While not as fast as previous years, it\u2019s \u201ca pace that will likely keep Colorado in the top 10 nationally,\u201d the CU report said. Professional and Business Services, arguably the most desirable sector, will see the largest growth. CU forecasts 11,400 new jobs in that higher education wage, higher wage sector which includes lawyers, engineers and computer design.\n\nOther leading sectors have a very different worker profile.\n\nForecasters expect retail, restaurant and hotel jobs to see tremendous growth. These jobs follow the professional jobs and are supported by the spending of higher wage workers. Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (including retail jobs) will grow by 8,700 jobs. The Leisure and Hospitality is expected to add 7,500 jobs.\n\nThe competition for hotel and restaurant workers is especially intense and has pinched the state\u2019s gambling industry. The December opening of the massive Gaylord Resort in Aurora, along with the growth in tourism generally, has hotels scrambling for people to make beds, cook food and check in guests. Growing confidence in the economy has more people travelling for business and pleasure.\n\nThe good news for low-wage earners is the pay isn\u2019t so low anymore. Intense competition for all workers, especially as unemployment hovers around 3 percent, has pushed paychecks up.\n\nLoading Graphic...\n\nAll Colorado industries have seen wage growth. Average annual pay was up 3.1 percent in 2018, according to the report. However, inflation was up 3.2 percent in the first half of 2018, which led some workers to feel that they moved sideways.\n\nA Workforce Evolution\n\nBeyond pay, the need for talent up and down Colorado\u2019s economy, continues to reshape the workforce in profound ways. CU economists note a substantial increase in the Labor Force Participation Rate in Colorado, from a low of 66.6 percent in 2015 to 69 percent in 2018. That was enough to rank Colorado third highest in the nation for participation. Even younger generations, long a source of concern among economists, are working at much higher rates here than in other states.\n\nColorado\u2019s population boom still holds sway. Californians, Texans and New Yorkers continue to move in and fill many of the open jobs. In-migration to Colorado has weakened over the years, but a net in-migration of 50,000 is expected in 2019. A byproduct of the ballooning population is many have left the Denver metro for cheaper locations, which the CU economists warn could be a risk to Colorado\u2019s long-term growth. While wages are up, they have not grown as fast as home prices or average rents.\n\nThe population growth is also a driver of construction, in both offices and homes. An additional 28,100 single family homes in 2019 will help to drive construction employment to 176,800 workers, a 2.9 percent increase. There\u2019s also a fair amount of public projects on the books, including a $1.5 billion renovations at DIA and another $1.5 billion in school bonds approved in the last election.\n\nAg Still Lagging\n\nWhile all sectors are expected to grow jobs next year, not every industry feels good about future prospects. Agriculture, in particular, is still in a prolonged downturn. The drought that covered half the state last year ate into rancher profits. Cattle ranching is king in Colorado and represents the majority of the ag economy. But farmers also felt the pinch. Prices for corn and wheat are low, due to oversupply globally. CU expects 2018 farm and ranch income to be the lowest since 2002.\n\n\u201cFarmers are always fighting the weather, but now they are weathering a storm of low commodity prices, trade uncertainties, and unfavorable economic conditions,\u201d the report states.", "keywords": ["wage", "growth", "stop", "workers", "cu", "colorado", "colorados", "youve", "heard", "economy", "2018", "expected", "low", "2019", "jobs", "great"], "summary": "Audio: Ben Markus breaks down the 2019 Colorado Business Economic OutlookConstruction at the Denver Art Museum Friday November 9, 2018.\nHart Van Denburg/CPR NewsColorado\u2019s economy is expected to add more than 53,000 jobs in 2019.\n\u201cNobody has a recession in 2019,\u201d stated Richard Wobbekind a professor at the CU Boulder\u2019s Leeds School of Business.\nCU forecasts 11,400 new jobs in that higher education wage, higher wage sector which includes lawyers, engineers and computer design.\nThese jobs follow the professional jobs and are supported by the spending of higher wage workers."}, {"link": "http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2018/12/11/mta-raises-subway-speed-limits-after-fixing-dozens-of-faulty-signal-timers", "published": "2018-12-11T00:04:00", "title": "MTA Raises Subway Speed Limits After Fixing Dozens of Faulty Signal Timers", "author": ["Pm Et Dec."], "text": "The MTA is trying to put some zip into your plodding subway trip by increasing the speed limit in 100 subway corridors as part of a major push to cut delays and improve service.\n\nThe agency began increasing the speed limits in selected locations over the weekend after months of testing to determine where trains could speed up without compromising safety.\n\n\"Even a small saving of seconds can result in a significant change because that is felt over the course of the entire line,\u201d said Sally Librera, the chief officer of the MTA Staten Island Railway. \u201cSo we're looking for seconds everywhere we can get them.\"\n\nThe first speed limit increase came along the N and R line in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.

Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nNear the banks of Istanbul\u2019s Golden Horn, a natural harbor that has protected Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman trading ships for thousands of years, a billboard displays the Turkish lira\u2019s market rate: its value in dollars, euros, pounds, and bitcoin. That last one might be surprising, given that cryptocurrencies have experienced a massive sell-off this year, with bitcoin plunging as much as 33 percent in November. But its persistence in countries like Turkey points to the future of money and the global financial system. Since October, as bitcoin suffered record losses, trading volumes on Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges increased by 37 percent.\n\nThe summer\u2019s lira crisis\u2014in which Turks saw their life savings, pensions, and investments significantly devalued\u2014paired with the country\u2019s savvy youthful population could help explain why many are searching for alternatives to fiat currency (money backed by government regulation). A pair of recent surveys highlight the draw of cryptocurrency in the country: An ING/Ipsos study conducted between March 26 and April 6 (that is, before the lira crisis) found that 18 percent of Turks surveyed\u2014compared with 9 percent of Europeans\u2014own cryptocurrency. The U.S. rate, according to the study, stood at 8 percent. A Turkish research firm called Twentify found similar numbers in a poll taken after the lira crisis toward the end of August, when bitcoin dropped by nearly 10 percent that month: Nearly one-fifth of survey respondents admitted to purchasing and selling Bitcoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community\u2019s response to the lira crisis tells a story of how geopolitics, emergent technologies, and financial speculators can converge for better or worse. The short of it involves the fate of an American pastor jailed in Turkey (who was released in August), and retaliatory tariffs by the U.S. against Turkish steel and aluminum imports. After Trump announced the tariffs via Twitter on Aug. 10, the lira lost more than 20 percent of its value in one day. Though the lira has since recovered much of its value, it is still down by more than 30 percent so far this year. Inflation also continues to be a major concern, hitting a 15-year high in September. Analysts warn that the Turkish economy could be heading into a recession.\n\nWith a plummeting national currency and fluctuating prices, it\u2019s no wonder Turks would consider investments set apart from state-regulated institutions, even given cryptocurrencies\u2019 risk and volatility. This phenomenon was noted by some in the cryptocurrency community: The anonymous co-owner of Bitcoin.org tweeted Aug. 13 that there had been a sizable increase in the number of visitors to the site from Turkey, adding, \u201cThis is how Bitcoin takes over the world \u2026 through replacing fiat currencies as they fall apart!\u201d\n\nEconomic crises have been important catalysts in the brief history of cryptocurrency. Greece and Venezuela have experienced increased interest in virtual currency during their recessions. After all, bitcoin was introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in a white paper published by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto wanted to create a system where individuals can send each other electronic cash online without a financial institution. The vast majority of our money is currently controlled by banks, entities that take a cut for facilitating our transactions to the tune of $1.7 trillion a year. A trustable decentralized currency that cuts the middleman out is a dream not just for the techno-anarchists among us, but also for countries like Turkey.\n\nEmin G\u00fcn Sirer, a Turkish-American professor of computer science who runs the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts at Cornell University, brought up several reasons for why virtual cash proves so alluring for Turks. Together, the country\u2019s demographics, its relatively young population compared to Europe, and the flexible adoption of new technology provide the conditions for an eager market for cryptocurrency. Culturally, Turks are drawn to financial schemes with a high profit margin, according to Sirer. With the economic uncertainty of the summer, a large amount of money in Turkey headed in that direction.\n\nWhen Venezuela faced a similar economic crisis, a depreciating bolivar with skyrocketing inflation, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro called for a nationally backed cryptocurrency called the petro linked to the country\u2019s crude reserves. Critics warned that it was a potential scam. Recently, Maduro increased the petro\u2019s value by 150 percent, prompting a prominent Venezuelan economist to cast doubt on whether the petro could be considered a cryptocurrency at all, since its value is determined by Maduro as opposed to the laws of supply and demand.\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) bitcoin\u2019s popularity in Turkey, state authorities have tried to sway people toward more conventional investments. In Turkey, Erdogan\u2019s strategy was to urge citizens to convert their dollars to shore up the flagging lira, while promoting trade with Russia, China, and Iran in national currencies. The state religious authority, Diyanet, also ruled that it was not \u201cpermissible\u201d for Muslims to use and trade cryptocurrencies. As if to prove the Diyanet\u2019s point, Turcoin, fraudulently billed as an alternative national currency, turned out to be a Ponzi scheme as the founders attempted to flee with millions.\n\nDespite the wildly speculative and fluctuating condition of cryptocurrency, it\u2019s seen as an attractive form of alternative investment in emerging markets. For instance, a U.N. report bills Africa as the next frontier. In Nairobi, a Swiss-based cryptocurrency trading platform has started a pilot program to issue digital tokens in place of hard currency for residents in one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. The tiny nation of Georgia is only second to China in the mining of bitcoins, and the first to secure land titles via the bitcoin network. Cryptocurrency remains an experiment in more reliable financial transactions, especially for those far from the global financial system\u2019s reach.\n\nVedat Akgiray, a professor of finance at Bogazici University in Istanbul, says that trust in financial institutions is at an all-time low, not just in Turkey. In 2013, when then\u00ad\u2013Federal Reserve Board Chair Ben Bernanke announced the end of what is called quantitative easing, a policy that pumped more U.S. dollars into circulation, emerging market economies like Turkey started to feel the pinch. The lira\u2019s value against the dollar started to steadily decrease, as the Fed tightened the spigots and began to increase interest rates.\n\nFor Turks, the fundamental unfairness of being beholden to the maneuverings of a central bank in Washington, Brussels, or London, not to mention the erratic rhetoric and behavior of their own government, has pushed them toward such virtual alternatives. As Sirer puts it, cryptocurrencies essentially \u201ctie the hands of the sovereign in how money can be issued and controlled.\u201d For countries like Turkey operating under the hegemony of the dollar-dominated financial system, cryptocurrency remains an attractive albeit risky dream. \u201cIt\u2019s against everything we\u2019ve been accustomed to for centuries,\u201d says Akgiray. \u201cIt\u2019s a real change.\u201d", "keywords": ["turkey", "value", "bitcoin", "unstable", "lira", "cryptocurrency", "turks", "turkish", "currency", "money", "financial", "turning"], "summary": "Since October, as bitcoin suffered record losses, trading volumes on Turkish cryptocurrency exchanges increased by 37 percent.\nA Turkish research firm called Twentify found similar numbers in a poll taken after the lira crisis toward the end of August, when bitcoin dropped by nearly 10 percent that month: Nearly one-fifth of survey respondents admitted to purchasing and selling Bitcoin.\nThe cryptocurrency community\u2019s response to the lira crisis tells a story of how geopolitics, emergent technologies, and financial speculators can converge for better or worse.\nAfter Trump announced the tariffs via Twitter on Aug. 10, the lira lost more than 20 percent of its value in one day.\nThough the lira has since recovered much of its value, it is still down by more than 30 percent so far this year."}, {"link": "http://www.ktvu.com/news/bart-service-stopped-in-parts-of-east-bay-due-to-medical-emergency", "published": "2018-12-10T20:17:00", "title": "BART service restored after person struck on tracks", "author": [], "text": "BART has restored limited service between the Castro Valley and West Dublin/Pleasanton stations this afternoon after a person was struck on the tracks, a transit agency spokeswoman said.\n\nBART officials initially issued an advisory at 11:23 a.m. about a service disruption due to a \"major medical emergency.\"\n\nBART spokeswoman Anna Duckworth said shortly after noon that a person on the tracks was hit by a train, and that service was shut down in both directions between the two stations.\n\nAs of shortly before 1 p.m., Duckworth said limited service was resuming, with trains single-tracking through the area.\n\nNo update was immediately released on the condition of the person struck by the train.\n\nThis story is developing.

(Jerry Larson/Waco Tribune Herald/AP)\n\nA former fraternity president at Baylor University who had been accused of rape will not serve any jail time nor be forced to register as a sex offender after a judge accepted the plea deal he had been offered by Texas prosecutors, according to news reports.\n\nJacob Anderson, 23, had been charged with four counts of sexual assault after he was accused of raping a 19-year-old woman at a 2016 party thrown by Phi Delta Theta, the fraternity chapter of which he was president, at the school in Waco, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\nBut earlier this year, the McLennan County district attorney\u2019s office offered him a plea deal that quickly became the subject of bitter outcry from both the victim and her family, as well as many others paying attention to the case.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office dismissed the four counts of sexual assault in exchange for a lesser charge of unlawful restraint, according to news reports. And it recommended that Anderson serve three years of deferred adjudication probation \u2014 meaning the charge could eventually be dismissed if he doesn\u2019t violate the terms of his probation \u2014 be fined $400 and go to counseling in lieu of jail time, according to news reports.\n\nThe case\u2019s closure Monday was punctuated by sobs from the victim, who had asked the judge to reject the plea offer and set a trial date so she could testify in court, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald.\n\nIn a victim impact statement she read later, she called out the assistant district attorney on the case, Hilary LaBorde, and McLennan County District Attorney Abel Reyna, neither of whom attended the hearing, the Tribune-Herald reported.\n\n[A man with a machete killed their parents. Then it was their turn to speak in court.]\n\n\"If I had the courage to come back to Waco and face my rapist and testify, you could at least have had enough respect for me to show up today,\u201d she said. \u201cYou both will have to live with this decision to let a rapist run free in society without any warning to future victims.\u201d\n\nAnd she had harsh words for Anderson.\n\n\u201cIt must be horrible to be you,\u201d she said, the newspaper reported. \u201cTo know what you did to me.

Anderson was indicted in June; he was also expelled from Baylor.\n\nThe victim told police that she woke up choking on her own vomit, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God I am alive today to fight this injustice,\u201d the victim wrote in her impact statement. \u201cOne breath either way and Jacob Walter Anderson would be on trial for murder.\u201d\n\nLaBorde and Reyna did not respond to requests for comment sent to their email addresses.

Rather, in their sentencing recommendation for fixer Michael Cohen, lawyers with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York wrote that in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, candidate Trump directed Cohen to pay off Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who wanted money to keep quiet about sexual dalliances. While such arrangements are legal, prosecutors argued that since the payoffs occurred during the campaign, they were violations of campaign finance laws.\n\nCohen, who is cooperating because prosecutors nailed him for tax evasion and bank fraud in his private business, pleaded guilty to two felony campaign finance violations. So no one has to talk about an \"alleged\" campaign finance scheme; there's already a guilty plea. But what was really significant about the sentencing memo was that prosecutors specifically said Trump told Cohen to do it.\n\n\"With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" prosecutors said. \"He acted in coordination with and at the direction of [Trump].\"\n\nThose words caused a sudden shift in the debate over investigating the president. What had been a two-year-long conversation about Trump and Russia instantly became a conversation about Trump and campaign finance.\n\n\"Prosecutors are now implicating the president in at least two felonies,\" said CNN.\n\n\"Federal prosecutors in New York say that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to commit two felonies,\" said NBC's Chuck Todd.\n\n\"At least two felonies,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n\"Implicated in two felonies,\" said anti-Trump gadfly George Conway, husband of top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\"There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him,\" said Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who will become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee next month, \"that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.\"\n\nJerry Nadler, the Democrat who will chair the House Judiciary Committee, said the campaign finance charges \"would be impeachable offenses because, even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office.\" Nadler said he has still not determined whether the charges, even though they could be the basis for impeachment, are important enough to actually go forward, at least yet.\n\nNadler's public caution is understandable; his committee will have the responsibility of starting the impeachment process, if that is what Democratic leaders decide. But the fact is, a number of Democrats clearly believe they already have enough evidence to impeach.\n\nOne significant problem could be that the campaign finance charge against the president is a pretty iffy case. Back in 2010, the Justice Department accused 2008 presidential candidate John Edwards of a similar scheme \u2014 an alleged campaign finance violation based on a payoff to a woman with whom Edwards had had an affair (and a child).\n\nEdwards said he arranged the payment to save his reputation and hide the affair from his wife. The Justice Department said it was to influence the outcome of a presidential election.\n\nThe New York Times called the Edwards indictment \"a case that had no precedent.\" Noting that campaign finance law is \"ever changing,\" the paper said the Edwards case came down to one question: \"Were the donations for the sole purpose of influencing the campaign or merely one purpose?\"\n\nThe Justice Department failed miserably at trial. Edwards was acquitted on one count, while the jury deadlocked in Edwards' favor on the others. Prosecutors opted not to try again.\n\nPresident Trump would point out that the accusation against him differs in at least one key respect from Edwards. Prosecutors accused Edwards of raising donor money to pay off the woman. Trump used his own money, which even the byzantine and restrictive campaign finance laws give candidates a lot of freedom to use in unlimited amounts.\n\nSo even more than Edwards, if the Justice Department pursued a case against Trump, it would be on unprecedented grounds.\n\nBut the political reality is, it doesn't really matter if it is a weak case. And it doesn't matter if Trump himself has not been indicted, or even that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Because now, Democrats can say, \"The Justice Department has implicated the president in two felonies. Two felonies. TWO FELONIES!\"\n\nPolitically, that's as good as an indictment of Trump. Perhaps even better, since it does not give the president a forum to make a proper legal defense.\n\nThe last few days have seen a big pivot in the campaign against Donald Trump. For two-plus years, it was Russia, Russia, Russia. But despite various revelations in the Russia probe, the case for collusion remains as sketchy as ever. Now, though, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have given Democrats a new weapon against the president.

Roof is in an Indiana prison awaiting execution. According to a U.S. attorney\u2019s office press release, Lecron also \u201cattempted to send [Roof] Nazis literature.\u201d\n\nLecron allegedly had a Tumblr account called \u201cCharlestonChurchMiracle,\u201d on which she posted photos and comments about mass shootings.\n\nThe FBI says agents raided Lecron\u2019s home and found an AK-47, a shotgun, handguns and materials that could be used to construct pipe bombs. Agents also found her journal, in which she allegedly wrote about committing \u201cupscale mass murder.\u201d\n\nLecron studied the entrances and exits of the bar she planned to attack, authorities said.\n\nShe also allegedly expressed interest in committing other attacks.

He is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to ISIS.\n\nHe was arrested Friday after purchasing two AR-15 rifles from an undercover agent, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Toledo.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of months, Damon Joseph progressed from radicalized, virtual jihadist to attack planner,\u201d FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeff Fortunato said in a statement. \u201cHe ultimately decided to target two Toledo-area synagogues for a mass-casualty attack in the name of ISIS.\u201d\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Joseph came to the attention of FBI agents after posting photos of weapons to his social media accounts.

And with his vote-counting acumen under attack from outside the Capitol, Cornyn said he finds the criticism \u201cbizarre\u201d as he deals with the warring factions of his party and a year-end time crunch.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve supported a long, long time. I had a conversation as recently as this morning with National Sheriffs\u2019 Association and the head of the Texas Sheriffs\u2019 Association to try and get this thing where actually more of the Republican Conference would support it,\u201d Cornyn said Monday. \u201cThe criticism is either from people who don\u2019t understand what the job of the whip is, or how actually legislation gets passed.\u201d\n\nHe added one last brushback to his critics: Advocates\u2019 \u201cenergy is best channeled into trying to get more votes.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Cornyn and McConnell\u2019s internal whip count hasn\u2019t moved even as Republicans have continued to build support for the bill. Grassley said his effort has \u201cgone from a lot less than 30\u201d Republicans to 30 of 51 in the Senate GOP and that he\u2019s puzzled at why Cornyn isn\u2019t one of them when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) endorsed the bill last week.\n\nWith Democrats taking back the House and a fragile compromise hanging in the balance, as Grassley put it: \u201cWhat more do you need from a law enforcement standpoint than a guy like Cruz?!\u201d\n\n\u201cHis state has been very successful at reforms. And that\u2019s saving lots of money. So I\u2019m just a little confused. I\u2019m just a little confused,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cCommon sense tells me he needs to be for it.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Cornyn is \u201cnavigating\u201d a difficult situation as well as he can. But he, too, said GOP leaders are underestimating the bill\u2019s support.\n\nCornyn\u2019s \u201chotter on it than the majority leader is,\u201d Flake said of the criminal justice reform. But according to his \u201cunscientific\u201d whip count \u201cthere\u2019s a pretty good majority for it.\u201d\n\nThe skirmish comes at an inflection point for Cornyn. He has just three weeks left in the party leadership because of term limits and is beginning to prepare for a reelection campaign after Democrats\u2019 strongest performance in Texas in decades. He\u2019s also dealing with a fight over Trump\u2019s border wall and must make sure the GOP has the votes to prevent a partial government shutdown.\n\nMcConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, has repeatedly stated there\u2019s probably not enough room in the schedule to move the criminal justice bill. Yet he\u2019s also not entirely ruled out action, giving advocates a ray of hope for the latest version of the bill, which still has not been introduced.\n\nCornyn was a lead sponsor of sweeping criminal justice reform during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency that never become law, but argued for a narrower proposal when the law-and-order Trump took office. But now Trump is endorsing a broader package that includes both prison and sentencing reforms and is urging passage of the bipartisan agreement before the GOP loses unified control of Congress.\n\nThe No. 2 Senate Republican says he hopes Congress can get it done. But given his track record on the issue and unique position of influence, advocates for the sentencing reform bill say Cornyn should be doing more, even as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) offers biting criticisms of the bill.\n\nGrassley and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have publicly touted the swelling support, in contrast to Cornyn. The Dallas Morning News asserted Cornyn has been \u201ctepid\u201d in his leadership on the issue. And longtime reformers say Cornyn is getting cold feet.\n\n\u201cI have no sympathy for John Cornyn. None. If he\u2019s in an awkward spot it\u2019s because he put himself here,\u201d said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, a supporter of the reform bill who also blamed McConnell for not scheduling a vote. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this across the finish line, the person I will blame is John Cornyn.\u201d\n\nHolly Harris, executive director of the Justice Action Network, accused Cornyn of providing McConnell with an inaccurate whip count last week. On Monday, Harris seemed more optimistic about Cornyn\u2019s involvement, though she said because of the \u201ccraziness of the competing whips, there\u2019s a lot of frustration in the reform community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing very positive things about his engagement,\u201d Harris said as the bill\u2019s supporters prepared to release their final compromise. \u201cSen. Cornyn is a powerful man. He hails from a place that is considered the birthplace of criminal justice reform. \u2026 You always have a complicated situation when you\u2019re a member of leadership.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Cornyn\u2019s role in the GOP at this moment would be difficult for anyone: McConnell is \u201creally reluctant\u201d to bring the bill to the floor, Grassley said. And Cornyn\u2019s job is to assess support for the legislation in the caucus. He can\u2019t exactly twist arms for the bill if McConnell is simply trying to get a dispassionate view of the conference, even if supporters think a lot of undecided Republicans would vote \u201cyes\u201d if forced to.\n\n\u201cMy job as whip is to give Leader McConnell an accurate count of where the conference is. Because he doesn\u2019t want to put anything on the floor and be surprised,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cA majority of the conference either whipped \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018undecided.\u2019 And we need to get those undecideds into the \u2018yes\u2019 column to get at least a majority of a majority in favor of the bill. And I think that will be persuasive.\u201d\n\nA GOP senator said that internally many Republicans are declining to take a firm position, making it more difficult to truly gauge support. Cornyn\u2019s allies also believe Grassley and Lee are being overly optimistic in how they are reading backing for the bill.\n\nBut Cornyn\u2019s influence alone could help Republicans get over the top given his reputation as a leader on the criminal justice issue.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re able to get it done it\u2019s because, in part, he brought people on,\u201d said one Republican senator, who estimated 20 of the GOP\u2019s 51 members are locked in as supporters of the bill. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the few who could.\u201d\n\nIn some ways Cornyn is hamstrung by his role in leadership and deference to McConnell. But if there\u2019s ever a time for him to exert his influence on a topic he\u2019s passionate about, now might be his last, best shot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of leadership. And he probably has to do what leadership asks him to do,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["falters", "mcconnell", "majority", "gop", "criminal", "senate", "republicans", "whip", "bill", "justice", "cornyn", "reform"], "summary": "Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn has found himself in the middle of an internal GOP firefight in the final days of the lame duck.\n| Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Congress Cornyn under fire from GOP as criminal justice reform falters Advocates of the Trump-endorsed bill say the Senate GOP whip isn\u2019t accurately counting votes.\nJohn Cornyn is facing a grievous insult during a last-ditch effort to pass criminal justice reform: Senate Republicans can\u2019t trust their own whip\u2019s count.\nCornyn\u2019s \u201chotter on it than the majority leader is,\u201d Flake said of the criminal justice reform.\nHe hails from a place that is considered the birthplace of criminal justice reform."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/10/politics/washington-post-44-senators-defend-democracy-op-ed/index.html", "published": "2018-12-11T02:58:00", "title": "44 former US senators urge current Senate to defend democracy in op-ed", "author": ["Kate Sullivan"], "text": "(CNN) Forty-four former Republican and Democratic US senators penned an op-ed for The Washington Post that warns \"we are entering a dangerous period\" and urges current and future senators to be \"steadfast and zealous guardians of our democracy.\"\n\nThe former senators write in the op-ed they feel an \"obligation to speak up about serious challenges to the rule of law, the Constitution, our governing institutions and our national security.\"\n\n\"We are on the eve of the conclusion of special counsel Robert S.

Trejo will be charged as an adult under state law.\n\nRouhselang was reported missing by her parents Sunday morning around 4:30 a.m., according to the court document.

The Supreme Court has now decided to pass on the cases.\n\nOnly four justices are needed to agree to grant a hearing on any case. So to stop it from reaching the high court, it took Kavanaugh siding with Chief Justice John Roberts and liberal justices.\n\nThree conservative justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 all voted to hear the case.\n\nSupreme Court watchers are hanging on every sign from Kavanaugh and Roberts as to how they may rule on abortion given the new makeup of the bench. While it's difficult to assess what implications this particular decision says about their thinking on the issue, the decision not to hear these cases is at least noteworthy, as it suggests a certain level of caution on taking on contentious cases involving abortion in any way.\n\nIn a dissent, Thomas complained that the court wanted to shy away from the case because it involves Planned Parenthood, even though it doesn't have any direct implications on abortion rights.\n\n\"So what explains the Court\u2019s refusal to do its job here?\" Thomas wrote. \"I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named 'Planned Parenthood.' That makes the Court\u2019s decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion. It is true that these particular cases arose after several States alleged that Planned Parenthood affiliates had, among other things, engaged in 'the illegal sale of fetal organs' and 'fraudulent billing practices,' and thus removed Planned Parenthood as a state Medicaid provider ... But these cases are not about abortion rights. They are about private rights of action under the Medicaid Act. Resolving the question presented here would not even affect Planned Parenthood\u2019s ability to challenge the States\u2019 decisions; it concerns only the rights of individual Medicaid patients to bring their own suits.\"\n\nThis certainly does not sound like a majority that is chomping at the bit to overturn Roe v.

At this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here.\" @GeraldoRivera Time for the Witch Hunt to END! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2018\n\nThe President has a long record of disregarding evidence that contradicts his preferred version of events. And Trump has mounted a long campaign to discredit the special counsel, apparently seeking to devalue any eventual conclusions that are critical of his conduct.\n\nBut the deepening record of the Mueller investigation is raising the possibility that Trump's talent in creating alternative realities is facing its stiffest test yet.\n\nNew and damaging information for the White House comes at a time when every move by Mueller appears to bring his investigation deeper into the White House and Trump's inner circle, and shows it has expanded well beyond what may or may not have happened in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSo the President has every reason to change the subject.\n\nKelly's departure has long been expected given an apparently fractious relationship with the President and his diminishing influence in a riotous White House he once tried to tame with military-style discipline.\n\n\"I appreciate his service very much,\" Trump said, of a respected retired general who also served as his first homeland security secretary.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Saturday that Trump was in talks with Nick Ayers, who current serves as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, to succeed Kelly. But the elevation of Ayers is not certain, as he is looking to move his young family back to Georgia and may only want to do the job in the short term.\n\nTrump also took time to tweet about violence in France that has rocked the Macron government and caused the cancellation of fuel tax increases designed to wean consumers off fossil fuels that cause global warming.\n\n\"Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes?\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nDeepening jeopardy\n\nTaunting a fellow world leader who was once a friend but has recently criticized the President's nationalistic worldview might be a pleasant diversion for Trump, but cannot change the reality of the widening special counsel probe.\n\nMueller is clearly now looking not just at allegations of possible cooperation of Trump associates with Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, but at possible obstruction of justice even after the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That much became clear when CNN reported on Friday that the special counsel has spoken to Kelly in recent months. The chief of staff did not even take the job until July 2017.\n\nA series of filings and court action this week by Mueller, federal prosecutors and attorneys for the President's former lawyer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn appeared to significantly sharpen the threats facing Trump and key associates.\n\nNone of the documents amount to criminal action against the President himself. But they tell an indirect tale of allegedly questionable behavior by the then-GOP nominee.\n\nFor the first time, prosecutors said Trump directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump, which broke campaign finance laws.\n\nMueller also drew a link between Trump's business interests and the Russian election meddling effort. He pointed out that work on a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project that continued until deep into the campaign in June 2016 -- and which Cohen lied about -- came \"at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election.\"\n\nMueller also confirmed that he has benefited from substantial cooperation from Cohen and Flynn, and that he has documentary evidence in addition to testimony from witnesses. This raises the likelihood that he has built a comprehensive picture into what went on in the Trump campaign, the transition and in the White House, even though he is yet to reveal everything publicly in heavily redacted documents.\n\nTrump and his legal team insist, however, that the President is in the clear.\n\n\"When you look at what was revealed today, there's nothing that links the President to collusion with the Russians, so maybe they should fold up their tent, give a report to the Justice Department and go home,\" Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Pam Brown on Friday.\n\nGiuliani also said the President never told Cohen to pay women who claimed affairs with him, adding that such payments would not count as a campaign contribution.\n\nThe depth of the President's legal and political difficulties will only become clear when Mueller files a final report -- and Trump's team will have the chance to challenge his findings and make their defense. But it's increasingly looking like the President's denials and distractions are failing to keep up with the special counsel's accelerating pace.", "keywords": ["trumps", "cohen", "white", "russian", "tries", "campaign", "cloud", "presidents", "collusion", "russia", "darkens", "change", "trump", "president", "special"], "summary": "\"We're very happy with what we're reading because there was no collusion whatsoever,\" Trump told reporters before heading to the Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia.\nAt this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion.\n\u2014 Donald J.

The former FBI director is a true believer in his own sublime moral superiority. He also currently portrays the chief protagonist in one of the longest running political tragicomedies since Watergate.\n\nSometimes a public figure\u2019s demise is sudden, unexpected. Other times, as in the case of Comey, the end is preceded by an extended period of self-inflicted diminution; an inexorable march towards ruination of personal reputation. But in this case, hubris not only takes down the man generously imbued with it, but also does irreparable damage to an institution (the FBI) that he has repeatedly and demonstratively professed to love.\n\nComey\u2019s denouement occurred on Friday. He arrived on Capitol Hill accompanied by his counsel, David N. Kelley, the man who succeeded him as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. When first subpoenaed last month to appear and testify before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, a cagey Comey employed the tactic of his chief antagonist (President Trump) in speaking directly to the people, via Twitter :\n\n\n\nHappy Thanksgiving. Got a subpoena from House Republicans. I\u2019m still happy to sit in the light and answer all questions. But I will resist a \u201cclosed door\u201d thing because I\u2019ve seen enough of their selective leaking and distortion. Let\u2019s have a hearing and invite everyone to see. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) November 22, 2018\n\nClearly the irony of Comey decrying \u201cselective leaking\u201d could be lost on no one, except maybe Comey himself. His FBI headquarters was admonished by a scathing Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report for its sieve-like qualities, and Comey famously leaked sensitive FBI documents through a surrogate to The New York Times.\n\nWas his use of the word \"resist\" here a purposeful acknowledgment of the #Resistance? Difficult to not also notice the loudest message inherent in Comey\u2019s tweet \u2013 his clear and obvious disdain for the GOP he once claimed political affiliation with, and the contemptuous derision he feels towards House Republicans in particular.\n\nComey has long shed any pretense of objectivity since being fired by the president in May 2017. He now employs Twitter as his cudgel of choice \u2013 again, adopting the preferred communiqu\u00e9 methodology of one Donald J. Trump. He has tweeted out a caution to Democrats to \u201cplease, please don\u2019t lose your minds and rush to the socialist left.\u201d Because, according to Comey, \u201cThis President and his Republican Party are counting on you to do exactly that.\u201d\n\nHe has sided with Senate Democrats in questioning the testimony of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while also lauding a Democratic candidate for winning a mid-term race in a district he reveled in pointing out had been held by Republicans since 1981. While encouraging his followers to vote in the midterm elections, he also described his wife as an \u201cindependent-voter,\u201d then quoted her thusly: \u201cI will not vote for another Republican until Trump is out of office.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with Boston\u2019s WGBH News , he also took an unnecessary dig at Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, warning, \u201cHe may not be the sharpest knife in our drawer.\u201d Lest we forget the gratuitous shots at his former boss at the Southern District, Rudy Giuliani , whom Comey described as somewhat of a glory-hound in his tell-all tome, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.\n\nAgain, the jokes just write themselves.\n\nWith all this \u201cnonpartisanism\u201d as backdrop, it's no surprise Comey balked at the GOP-issued subpoena. It certainly wasn\u2019t a shock when he challenged the House subpoena in court. His request to have the subpoena rejected contained the deliciously ironic concern that potential leaks would damage his credibility and harm the public\u2019s perception of FBI investigations. It also included the employment of a consistent lamentation from Comey\u2019s legion of media defenders \u2013 of a \u201ccorrosive narrative\u201d emanating from the White House, and of course, anyone who dares criticize James Comey.\n\nNo defense of Comey is complete without counteracting just criticism of him and some of his cohorts as \u201cattacks for purely partisan political reasons.\u201d\n\nComey ultimately conceded to the closed-door hearing, with a caveat that the transcript of the proceedings would be released within 24 hours of its conclusion. He Twitter -snarked afterwards that it was less a \u201csearch for truth\u201d and more \u201ca desperate attempt to find anything that can be used to attack the institutions of justice investigating the president.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday wasn\u2019t a search for truth, but a desperate attempt to find anything that can be used to attack the institutions of justice investigating this president. They came up empty today but will try again. In the long run, it'll make no difference because facts are stubborn things. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) December 8, 2018\n\n\n\nAh, the classic political pivot away from wrongdoing, as in: Please don\u2019t focus on my questionable or indefensible actions. Any criticism of me is a \u201ccorrosive attack on the institutions of justice.\u201d\n\nThus necessitated a review of the 235-page transcript . And like almost everything debated in 2018 America these days, opiners and commentators saw in it what they expected to see. As is typical during hearings on the Hill, the party that senses political utility in the witness\u2019s testimony becomes a sympathetic ally lobbing softball questions and bristling at any in-depth probing of the person under subpoena. Conversely, the opposition party serves as the aggrieved party and doggedly pursues the truth \u2013 according to their version of it.\n\nThe usual partisan cast was assembled on risers last Friday, eager to express their solidarity or disassociation with the witness. Once concluded, Republicans almost immediately tasked staffers to aggregate Comey\u2019s responses to key questions. Some then raced to Twitter to diagnose the former director with a mild bout of selective amnesia. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., tweeted the score:\n\n\n\nThe transcript from yesterday's James Comey interview is out. It includes:\n\n\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 - 166 times\n\n'I don\u2019t remember' - 71 times\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t recall\u2019 - 8 times\n\n\n\nRead the transcript for yourself. Does this sound like someone interested in telling the full story? \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) December 8, 2018\n\nThen, just like clockwork, and consistent with how Trump tends to reward those who either praise him or criticize his critics, on Sunday came a report out of the White House that the president is considering Meadows to replace current White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\n\nDemocratic response to Comey\u2019s testimony was predictably summed up by Rep. Jerrold Nadler\u2019s, D-N.Y., take. Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, pronounced the proceedings a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and questions about bias at the FBI during Comey\u2019s tenure as director as \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nA polarized take on the affair by the engaged political parties \u2013 no news there. But some who carefully scrutinized the transcript and have closely followed the investigation into bias at DOJ and the FBI did sense some interesting developments. John Solomon at the Hill noted that Comey effectively admitted that much of the infamous dossier remained unverified some six months following the original FISA application that had used it as a predicate evidentiary source.\n\nChuck Ross of the Daily Caller noticed that Comey admitted that George Papadopoulos was not the lone catalyst for the opening of \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d long the conventional wisdom. The counterintelligence investigation related to the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged ties to the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential campaign was opened in July 2016, and targeted four, now ubiquitous, individuals: Carter Page, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Papadopoulos.\n\nIt certainly defies credulity that some who vocally demand accountability from the Trump administration appear so disinterested in the \u201cfaulty memory\u201d of someone who kept copious notes of matters important enough to chronicle in his book. But was oblivious to easily discernible abnormalities related to the \u201cloosening\u201d of non-negotiable rules and guidelines at the FBI and DOJ. These guardrails are purposely enacted to make it damned difficult to intercept the communications of American citizens or spy on political campaigns.\n\nEven as we hurtle towards a new Congress that will result in an orderly transfer of power in the House this coming January, none of this will go away quietly. Comey is scheduled to return for another round on the Hill in front of the committees in two weeks. Anticipate hearing more from the former director regarding just how little he knew about his command and what they were up to during an exceedingly sensitive and consequential investigation. For the public, this will undoubtedly inject even more doubts about the conduct of segments of our government once considered impartial and unbiased and duty-bound to follow the rule of law.\n\nAnd that should be unsettling to all of us.\n\nJames A.

I sensed it!\" she said, highlighting a member of the audience who reacted to her revelation.\n\n\"One of the things that we discovered about ourselves is that a very very long time ago, generations and generations ago, my family consisted of Sephardic Jews,\" she said, referring to Jews who are originally from Spain or the Iberian Peninsula. \"And ... the story goes that during the Spanish Inquisition, so many people were forced to convert on the exterior to Catholicism, but on the interior, continued to practice their faith, continued to be who they were, even though they were pressured to not be that on the outside world.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who made the comments after lighting Hanukkah candles, said some of those practitioners fled Spain, with some landing in Puerto Rico, where she descends from. Ocasio-Cortez added that the lineage showed that \"so many of our destinies are tied.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Ocasio-Cortez posted a series of tweets about her Jewish heritage, responding to coverage of the remarks.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, about 300,000 Jews lived in Spain before the Catholic monarchs began the Spanish Inquisition in the late 1400s, in which all Jews and Muslims were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion or even death. The publication noted that more than 3.5 million Jews are descended from those who fled the country during the inquisition.\n\nThe Sunday revelation was not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has discussed her religion.

And while it was perfectly understandable, if not exactly admirable, for many people, especially the survivors of his victims, to feel he got what he deserved, seeing Bulger\u2019s demise as some form of brutal, poetic justice should not diminish the imperative that this question be answered: Why he was in a position to be murdered in the first place?\n\nIt is frankly scandalous that Bulger\u2019s medical classification was unilaterally changed so that he could be transferred from a prison in Florida where he was relatively safe to one in West Virginia where he plainly was not. There are people within the US Bureau of Prisons who had a hand in wink-winking and nod-nodding Bulger\u2019s reclassification and transfer, so expecting the bureau to be completely forthcoming is not realistic. The agency is hardly a study in transparency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne may be charitable and believe that the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, will do the right thing and bring all the circumstances to light. But, historically, the Justice Department has been compromised by Bulger. Besides, Hank Brennan, Bulger\u2019s lawyer, and Bulger\u2019s family aren\u2019t feeling particularly charitable at the moment, and who could blame them.\n\nGet Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nThe fact that Bulger, 89 and demonstrably in declining health, was suddenly, almost miraculously, deemed medically stable enough to be transferred to a prison with a lesser standard of health care services and placed in a general population that contained a number of organized crime figures from Massachusetts, including the Mafia hitman suspected of killing him, cries out for explanation.\n\nBy filing a lawsuit and thus being able to engage in the legal discovery process that will compel the Bureau of Prisons to turn over records and communications in the case, Bulger\u2019s lawyer and the family will conceivably be in a position to satisfy themselves that all the circumstances surrounding Bulger\u2019s transfer from the Coleman II facility in Florida to the US Penitentiary Hazelton in West Virginia are known.\n\nAgain, the irony will be thick, the distaste strong, that someone like Whitey Bulger will be defended as a man deserving of all our core rights, including the most essential right to life, that he denied so many others. But if the agency that runs the federal prison system believes it can act as recklessly as it appears to have done in the case of a high-profile inmate like Whitey Bulger, what are the prospects for the comparative nobodies doing time for offenses that don\u2019t come close to his level of criminal depravity?\n\nIn interviews, several people who work in the federal prison system told my colleague Shelley Murphy and me that the sort of subterfuge employed in Bulger\u2019s transfer is common, that prisoners who are considered troublesome, like Bulger, routinely have their medical classifications improperly changed to make it administratively possible to dump them on some other facility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that is true, that is something that the Bureau of Prisons internal investigation needs to explore, far beyond the particulars of Bulger\u2019s case.\n\nOf all the ironies, none is richer nor more poignant than the prospect of any compensatory damages awarded to Bulger\u2019s estate, in the event his estate prevails in the suit, going to the families of those he murdered. Such payments would be in accordance with a forfeiture judgment secured by prosecutors.\n\nThe Donahues of Dorchester will find themselves in the odd position of cheering on the Bulgers of South Boston, who now have something in common with the Donahues and some of Whitey Bulger\u2019s other victims: the agony of having their loved one murdered as a result of government duplicity.\n\nMany of Whitey Bulger\u2019s victims were treated shabbily by the government, but the treatment of the Donahue family was especially egregious. Michael Donahue was collateral damage in the FBI\u2019s cynical embrace of Whitey Bulger. In 1982, he made the innocent mistake of offering a ride home to an old neighborhood friend, Brian Halloran, who, unbeknownst to Donahue, had made the fatal mistake of shopping Bulger to the FBI.\n\nDetermined to protect Bulger as an informant, an FBI supervisor told Bulger\u2019s FBI handler John Connolly about Halloran, Connolly told Bulger, and when Bulger opened fire outside a waterfront bar the bullets meant for Brian Halloran killed Michael Donahue, too, leaving Patricia Donahue a widow and her sons Michael, Shawn, and Tommy fatherless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many other victims of Bulger\u2019s violence and the FBI\u2019s obsequiousness, the Donahues fought for justice for years. Two judges ordered the Justice Department to settle with the family, saying the FBI was responsible for Michael Donahue\u2019s murder. But rather than allow the family to collect the $6 million initially awarded to them, the Justice Department spent untold resources appealing the judgment, before finally getting lucky in 2011 with a 2-1 decision by the US Court of Appeals that found the Donahues waited too long to file their appeal. The two judges who ruled against the Donahues actually had the temerity to suggest the family, lied to by their own government, should have read the newspapers more closely.\n\nPatricia Donahue hopes the Bulger family gets the truth, which is a lot more than her family got all those years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even the money, so much as now the Bulgers will go through the same thing we did,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope they get some money, and I hope it goes to the victims. Then my kids can give their kids the things I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHer son Tommy doubts the Bulger family will prevail and doesn\u2019t want the money if they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Bulgers get anything, give it to my mother.

Steny Hoyer of Maryland and James Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe plan would be a dramatic shift for Pelosi, who has refused to put an end date on her tenure as she works to reclaim the speakership.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn would be able to serve three terms with an option for a fourth term if they can win the support of two-thirds of the caucus, according to multiple Democratic sources. The effect would be retroactive, meaning the two terms the trio ruled in the majority from 2007 to 2011 would count against their tenure.\n\nThe potential deal comes after days of private talks between Pelosi and a group of more than a dozen rank-and-file House Democrats who have publicly opposed her bid to be speaker.\n\nPelosi overwhelmingly won the Democratic nomination for speaker during caucus leadership elections a few weeks ago. But she still remains short of the 218 votes she needs to win the gavel during a House floor vote on Jan. 3.\n\nPelosi can lose 17 Democratic votes and still become speaker. Currently, around 20 Democrats are on record vowing to vote against her on the floor. The California Democrat is looking to peel off a handful of those rebels, and allowing a term-limits proposal to move forward could be the price she pays for any such deal.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Hoyer told reporters he\u2018s \u201cnot for term limits\u201c while walking into the House chamber on Monday night.\n\nPelosi and her detractors are also considering a plan to impose term limits on committee chairs, but that part of the deal is still fluid, according to Democratic sources with knowledge of the talks. A deal on term limits for committee chairs could be agreed to separately and at a later date, they said.\n\nPelosi has not agreed to any of the proposed changes and the parameters of the deal could still change, the sources cautioned.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), one of ringleaders of the rebel group, declined to comment on the proposal Monday night, citing \u201congoing negotiations.\u201c A spokesman for Pelosi\u2019s office also declined to comment.\n\nThe deal, if accepted, would be a compromise between rebel demands that Pelosi produce a firm end date for her leadership and the California Democrat\u2019s insistence that she won\u2019t make herself a lame duck speaker.\n\nEven if Pelosi and her critics agree to something, it\u2018s unclear when the broader caucus would meet to consider such sweeping changes to its leadership and committee structures.\n\nHouse Democrats will huddle on Tuesday morning for their regular weekly meeting. But Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the incoming caucus chairman, said no changes would be finalized then because the inbound Democratic freshmen are not in town to vote on any proposals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2018s possible that there will be some discussion about a broader rules package at some point this week, which could occur as early as tomorrow,\u201c Jeffries told reporters on Monday evening. But \u201cthere\u2018s no opportunity to vote up or down on any of these issues at this moment in time because the freshman members are not here,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, there are indications that Pelosi and her critics are working swiftly to reach an agreement. Several members of the anti-Pelosi group discussed the potential deal on a conference call Monday morning, and multiple sources close to the group said a final deal could come together in the coming days.\n\nWhile Pelosi can\u2019t bind Hoyer, the minority whip, Clyburn, the assistant Democratic leader, or other senior Democrats to such a measure, her support \u2014 or even benign neutrality \u2014 could be a major plus for term-limits backers inside the Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe reality is that Pelosi, at age 78, might not have any real worries with the term limits under discussion. The same goes for Hoyer and Clyburn, who are also in their late seventies.\n\nPelosi has previously said she'd planned to retire if Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election but stayed because she wanted to ensure that a woman was at the negotiating table with President Donald Trump. In recent months, Pelosi has talked broadly about being a \"transitional\" speaker, although she has rebuffed attempts to put an exact timeline on her exit.\n\nHowever, younger committee chair hopefuls and powerful factions within the caucus \u2014 such as the Congressional Black Caucus or Hispanic Caucus \u2014 might object to the proposal, no matter the length of the term limits. Yet the majority of rank-and-file House Democrats may support such a plan, since it would give them a chance to move up committee ranks or even into the leadership.\n\nJeffries, one of the up-and-comers who could be inhibited by the potential change, declined to weigh in on Monday night, citing his position as caucus chairman.\n\n\u201cI\u2018m unable to draw any conclusions one way or the other about it because I\u2018ll be the individual that will preside over the debate and the discussion,\u201c he said.\n\nEven in the absence of a deal between Pelosi and the rebels, House Democrats will need to deal with term limits soon as part of the rules package for the 116th Congress being assembled. Republicans have a three-term limit in place for their committee chairs as part of House rules, and Democrats will either have to keep that limit, revise it somehow, or drop it entirely when they take over the House on Jan. 3.\n\n", "keywords": ["rebels", "deal", "speaker", "caucus", "house", "limiting", "committee", "discuss", "democrats", "democratic", "term", "limits", "pelosi"], "summary": "Congress Pelosi, rebels discuss limiting her time as speaker to 4 yearsMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a group of House Democratic rebels are discussing a proposal to cap her time as speaker to four years, a move that could clear the way for the California Democrat to clinch the gavel in the coming days.\nPelosi overwhelmingly won the Democratic nomination for speaker during caucus leadership elections a few weeks ago.\nA deal on term limits for committee chairs could be agreed to separately and at a later date, they said.\nThe reality is that Pelosi, at age 78, might not have any real worries with the term limits under discussion.\nEven in the absence of a deal between Pelosi and the rebels, House Democrats will need to deal with term limits soon as part of the rules package for the 116th Congress being assembled."}, {"link": "http://time.com/5475820/trump-border-troops-home-christmas/", "published": "2018-12-10T20:46:10", "title": "U.S. Withdrawing 2,000 Troops From Border in Time for Christmas", "author": ["Lolita C.

But by the time firefighters arrived, it was too late. The blaze had caused the roof to collapse and destroyed the kingdom hall, the name Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses give to their worship centers.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives quickly ruled that the fire was intentionally set, saying it fit the pattern of the other kingdom hall attacks in Thurston County over the past nine months that have rocked the Jehovah\u2019s Witness community.\n\nNo one has been arrested, and the only image of a suspect is surveillance video of a person in a hoodie and coveralls pouring gasoline on the side of a hall, then sparking a bloom of fire. Authorities don\u2019t know whether that person is the only perpetrator, and a motive continues to elude investigators.\n\n\u201cWhy is this specific religion being targeted?\u201d Thurston County Sheriff John Snaza told KOMO, the ABC affiliate in Seattle. \u201cWhy are these churches being targeted? What are they doing that is so wrong and oppressive?\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthorities say the fire last week at a Jehovah's Witness prayer center in Washington state was intentionally set. (Thurston County Sheriff's Office)\n\nThe attacks began March 19, with intentionally set fires starting minutes apart, sending fire crews racing from a kingdom hall in Olympia to one in Tumwater, according to Seattle-area NBC affiliate KING. A July 3 fire also targeted the Olympia kingdom hall, this time destroying it. And Aug. 8, someone set a minor fire at a kingdom hall in Yelm. Authorities also recovered what they described as a dummy bomb at the scene.\n\nIn the midst of those attacks, on May 15, someone fired a volley of rifle rounds at the Yelm kingdom hall, causing about $10,000 in damage. Police collected nearly three dozen bullets.\n\nAll the attacks have occurred early in the morning, and there are no reports of injuries.\n\nStill, Jehovah\u2019s Witness leaders in the area say the attacks are a blow to their community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for the whole congregation,\u201d Dan Woollett, one of the ministers who helped build the hall in Lacey in 1976, told KING. \u201cIt does make you sad, but it\u2019s just a building. No matter who we are, no matter what our religious persuasion is, we have to cope with the problems we face.\"\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee tweeted a photo of the destruction in Lacey on Friday, calling the attacks \u201cabhorrent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe freedom to worship is a right that should be protected for every person in our country,\u201d the Democratic governor said. \u201cOur thoughts are with the members of our community affected by this abhorrent act.\u201d\n\n[Russia just effectively banned Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses from the country]\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses are known mostly for their door-to-door proselytizing, rejection of traditional holidays and refusal to accept blood transfusions even in the face of death. They reject subservience to the state, believing God to be the only true ruler. They do not serve in the military or vote.\n\nHistorically, attacks against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have threatened the group as a whole, not specific congregations. Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime put Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in concentration camps because they were apolitical and wouldn\u2019t join party organizations or let their children join the Hitler Youth. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, a special unit of the Gestapo compiled a registry of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and infiltrated their Bible studies.\n\nAnd last year, the Supreme Court in Russia declared Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses an extremist group, banning it from operating in the country after declaring its members a threat to \u201cpublic order and public security.\u201d The move was criticized by Human Rights Watch, a nongovernmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights matters.\n\nIn Washington, ATF is offering a reward of up to $36,000 for any information that leads to an arrest in the Washington crimes, and federal authorities have formed a local task force to find the suspect. Authorities are also working with the religious group to beef up security, but the threat appears to be far from over.\n\nSheriff Snaza speaking at the Press conference.

It covers crop insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- commonly referred to as food stamps -- as well as proposed changes to federal forest management policies.\n\nThe farm bill technically expired September 30, though major elements are funded through the end of the year.\n\nNegotiators recently came to an agreement on a final version after the House and Senate passed drastically different bills earlier this year. One of the major sticking points was the House bill's controversial addition of stricter work requirements for SNAP.\n\nThe new agreement, however, largely resembles the Senate version and excludes the stricter work requirements.\n\nViolence Against Women Act\n\nAlso high on the list is the Violence Against Women Act, which was set to expire on September 30. The bill has been extended through December 21, along with the must-pass spending bill to avoid the partial government shutdown.\n\nThe current law, enacted in 1994 and reauthorized ever since, addresses sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, primarily by providing grants and support to organizations and law enforcement programs that work with domestic violence victims and prevention.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans each introduced their own reauthorization bills this fall, but so far a final deal hasn't been reached. A Republican leadership aide said a lapse in funding for VAWA is not anticipated, but it's unclear whether a full five-year re-authorization with new legislation will happen in this Congress or the next.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who's the heavy favorite to be the next speaker of the House of Representatives , urged passage last week of a long-term re-authorization before the end of the year but said Democrats would take it up early next year if not.\n\n\"We'd like to do it this Congress, but if not we'll have to take it up at the beginning of next year,\" she said. \"But we'd rather do it (in) the Congress in which it was debated.\"\n\nDisaster relief funding\n\nThe same Republican leadership aide said the National Flood Insurance Program is also expected to see continued funding, even if it's unclear yet whether it will get a full re-authorization. The flood insurance program expired in 2017 but has been continued with multiple stopgaps ever since, and was most recently extended until December 21.\n\nThe program covers 5 million families in 22,000 communities. Lawmakers have been at odds over how to add investments and make reforms to the program to help mitigate flood costs. Regional divides also exist between those who want to see a smaller federal role in flood insurance and those who live in flood zones and coastal areas.\n\nAlong the lines of disaster relief, lawmakers are also trying to get emergency relief funding after devastating wildfires in California this year that cost dozens of lives and billions in damage.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Politico on Thursday she doesn't expect to get the $9 billion she requested for her state.\n\nFeinstein spokesman Tom Mentzer told CNN that the senator was referring to the fact that the $9 billion may not all come in the first round, but rather in several tranches as it has in the past.\n\n\"This isn't a problem now as there's sufficient disaster funds to pay for ongoing work,\" Mentzer said.\n\nSexual harassment legislation\n\nAlso on the docket for Congress -- though not necessarily must-pass items by the end of the year -- are key bills that remain in limbo as the clock ticks down. Sexual harassment reform in Congress is a high-profile item that was cleared in both chambers but through drastically different bills, and talks to merge the two bills together have stalled.\n\nRepublican Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership and chairman of the Rules Committee, said \"we need to get this settled.\"\n\n\"There is a House bill and there is Senate bill,\" added the senator from Missouri. \"So, we're down to where we could settle this with one vote on each side of the building and put it on the President's desk and it would be a huge mistake, I think, to miss this opportunity.\"\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who's set to become the next House majority leader, told reporters last week he was \"hopeful\" Congress would pass a final bill before the end of the year.\n\n\"If we don't, it's going to be very early on in our agenda next year,\" he said.\n\nIf these issues do come for a vote this month, it's unclear if they'll get added to the must-pass spending bill or if they'll get their own separate votes.\n\nWhen GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate appropriations committee, was asked about adding the farm bill, the Violence Against Women Act re-authorization and sexual harassment legislation to the government spending package, he said ultimately it was up to the leadership to decide but he preferred not piling on complicated and politically tricky bills to the spending bills.\n\n\"We want to keep as many non-appropriations-type items off the bill, because it helped us move to where we are today,\" he said last week.\n\nOverhauling the US prison and sentencing laws\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, there's a heated debate going on over criminal justice reform among Republicans. The legislation at hand, known as the First Step Act, would allow some current and future prisoners to get out earlier, and rehabilitate into society through halfway houses, home confinement or other supervision, by reducing drug-related mandatory sentences and making more offenders eligible for early release.\n\nThe bill has backing from President Donald Trump and some major Republican donors but faces fierce opposition among some Republicans who say now is not the time to tackle criminal justice reform.\n\nGOP leaders in the Senate have repeatedly said they are assessing whether to take the bill to the floor but acknowledge their Republican caucus is deeply divided on the reforms and there is very little time left in the session to debate changes to the bill.\n\n\"The question is can you shoe horn something that's extremely controversial into the remaining time,\" Senate Majority Leaders Mitch McConnell said at an event last week. \"It's extremely divisive inside the Senate Republicans conference.\"\n\nAlso in the Senate is a long-running debate over a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller, who's leading the Russia investigation. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term in January, has teamed up with Democrats to push for a vote on the bill, but those efforts have gone unsuccessful, as Senate GOP leaders have repeatedly said there's no need for such legislation.", "keywords": ["congress", "house", "reauthorization", "republican", "program", "end", "senate", "bill", "bills", "needs", "violence", "major"], "summary": "The farm bill technically expired September 30, though major elements are funded through the end of the year.\nOne of the major sticking points was the House bill's controversial addition of stricter work requirements for SNAP.\nDemocrats and Republicans each introduced their own reauthorization bills this fall, but so far a final deal hasn't been reached.\nSexual harassment legislationAlso on the docket for Congress -- though not necessarily must-pass items by the end of the year -- are key bills that remain in limbo as the clock ticks down.\n\"There is a House bill and there is Senate bill,\" added the senator from Missouri."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/06/politics/supreme-court-double-jeopardy-presidential-pardon-power/index.html", "published": "2018-12-10T16:41:00", "title": "Supreme Court double jeopardy case could impact presidential pardon power", "author": ["Ariane De Vogue", "Cnn Supreme Court Reporter"], "text": "Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court grappled on Thursday with a case concerning an exception to the Fifth Amendment's ban on prosecuting an individual twice for the same offense in a case that could also possibly impact President Donald Trump's pardon power as it applied to the Robert Mueller probe.\n\nDecades ago, the Supreme Court developed an exception to the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause and it is now being asked to rethink precedent.\n\nThe so-called \"separate sovereigns exception\" provides that a person can be tried twice for the same offense if the prosecutions occur in state and federal courts. The rationale is that the states and the federal government are different sovereigns.\n\nCritics contend that in the modern day it leads to harassment of defendants -- especially the poor -- who can't afford to fight on two fronts. They also point to a recent trend they argue has led to an increase of federal prosecutions in areas that had traditionally been left to the states.\n\nIn addition, it could also impact the presidential pardon power, leading to a question of what would happen if the President were to pardon an individual like his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for federal offenses. Under the exception, a state could conceivably bring a prosecution for the same crimes. That might not occur if the court were to strike the exception.\n\nIn court, the justices worried about the fact that the exception has been on the books for some 170 years.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan stressed that \"30\" justices have approved it over the years.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that while there may be problems with the doctrine, the court would need to find that precedent was \"grievously wrong\" before upsetting the stability of the law. \"When are we going to upset that stability, when are we going to depart from the humility of respecting precedent to overrule it?\"\n\nThat seemed to be the prevailing sentiment on the court.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer noted that overturning the exception could upend many corners of the law. \"Look at the door we are opening up,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, some justices recognized the complication of the debate and how the exception has been criticized by academics and judges who fear it could, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, amount to a \"double whammy\" for some defendants.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch pointed to what he called the modern problem of the \"proliferation of federal crimes\" that he said could prompt the government to seek a \"successive prosecution if it's unhappy with even the most routine state prosecution.\"\n\nA Justice Department attorney stressed that if the court were to strike the exception it would cause \"practical\" problems, deter cooperation, and prompt defendants to play the federal government against states.\n\nGamble prosecution\n\nThe case before the justices Thursday was brought by Terance Gamble, who was convicted of second-degree robbery in Alabama in 2008 and 2013. He was subsequently stopped in 2015 and found with a weapon in his car. Federal and state law forbid a convicted felon from possessing a firearm. After convictions in both federal and state courts, Gamble said that his dual convictions prolonged his incarceration by three years.\n\nAn appeals court ruled against him citing Supreme Court precedent which, the court said, \"has determined that prosecution in federal and state court for the same conduct does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the state and federal governments are separate sovereigns.\"\n\nGamble appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to overrule the separate sovereigns doctrine.\n\nIn court papers, Gamble's lawyers argued that \"for centuries\" federal and state criminal justice systems operated with little to no overlap and that state criminal law was dominant.\n\nIn the modern day, they say, that has changed.\n\nPresidential pardon power limits?\n\nAlthough the case does not touch on the special counsel's investigation, and the presidential pardon power did not come up in oral arguments, some believe that it might have ramifications for Manafort. The President has not ruled out the possibility of a pardon. If the Supreme Court strikes down the exception, a state could in theory be unable to prosecute him.\n\n\"There's more than nothing to the concern that, if the court overturns the separate-sovereigns doctrine, a state could not then prosecute someone like Paul Manafort for the federal crimes for which he might be pardoned,\" said CNN legal analyst and University of Texas Law School Professor Steve Vladeck.\n\n\"But the criminal jurisdiction of states tends to be so much broader than the federal government that such a move might not close the door to all potential criminal liability in such cases,\" Vladeck added.\n\nAdam Kurland, a professor of law at Howard University School of Law, doubts the case will impact the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"New York law already has a statute that limits some state prosecutions based on the same conduct as a prior federal prosecution,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department has urged the court to uphold the separate sovereigns exception, citing the intent of the framers.\n\n\"The framers wrote the Constitution to manifest the sovereign power of the United States and the states, including the power to enforce their own criminal laws,\" argued Principal Deputy Solicitor General Jeff Wall in court papers.\n\nWall also argued that under longstanding policy, the government only pursues a federal prosecution when the state case has left \"substantial federal interest demonstrably unvindicated.\"", "keywords": ["court", "law", "impact", "jeopardy", "pardon", "power", "presidential", "exception", "federal", "state", "prosecution", "case", "supreme", "double"], "summary": "Decades ago, the Supreme Court developed an exception to the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause and it is now being asked to rethink precedent.\nAn appeals court ruled against him citing Supreme Court precedent which, the court said, \"has determined that prosecution in federal and state court for the same conduct does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because the state and federal governments are separate sovereigns.\"\nGamble appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to overrule the separate sovereigns doctrine.\nPresidential pardon power limits?\nWall also argued that under longstanding policy, the government only pursues a federal prosecution when the state case has left \"substantial federal interest demonstrably unvindicated.\""}, {"link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOXEiyCR19w", "published": "2018-12-11T04:19:09", "title": "North Carolina 9th District: Records point to three coordinated absentee ballot efforts", "author": [], "text": "Published on Dec 10, 2018\n\nIt has been more than a month since the 2018 midterms, but North Carolina's 9th Congressional District election is far from over.

Follow Him On Twitter"], "text": "President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner told Fox News' \"Hannity\" exclusively on Monday that, despite increasingly critical media reports on the Trump administration and his role in it, the White House is humming along effectively as new officials prepare to take over top roles.\n\nKushner also touted his work spearheading the president's major criminal justice reform bill, which some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have resisted. The proposed legislation, which Kushner said was \"very close\" to becoming law, would reduce mandatory prison terms for certain drug crimes and give judges in some cases more discretion on punishments.\n\nIt additionally would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack-cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for reduced penalties, and would include provisions to encourage education and workforce training in prisons. Roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\n\"This bill will accomplish a lot to make our communities safer,\" Kushner said. \"The recidivism rate that we have is way too high, and not doing anything about that is irresponsible. And we\u2019re allowing people to go back to our communities who we can help, and there\u2019s a lot of programs based in red states that we\u2019ve really modeled this off of, so we know that this works.\n\n\n\n\"And, we\u2019ve been able to build a very strong bipartisan coalition under the president\u2019s leadership. They\u2019ve come up with a bill that we think can really solve a lot of those problems. And what it is, is going into the prisons and giving job training, vocational training, mentorship... mental health treatment, drug addiction treatment to people who are coming out, who are nonviolent offenders and figuring out how when they leave prison they have a better chance of getting a job and re-entering society in a productive manner than going back to a life of crime,\" Kushner continued.\n\nHe added that Democrats and Republicans were \"very close\" to voting on and passing the bill, and that \"hopefully this will get to the floor and we\u2019ll be able to have a big bipartisan celebration.\"\n\nThe bill \"ranks all the different inmates who are in our federal prison system under a likelihood of committing a crime in the future, and it allows us to put the focus on the nonviolent people who have a low risk,\" Kushner said. \"Like somebody like Alice Marie Johnson; that case was a grave misjustice and -- and the president did a great job towards righting that wrong, that that case really touched his heart and now is something where he realized that there was no reason for taxpayers to be paying to house somebody like Alice, when she can be out in society, being a good role model for others and taking the mistakes that she made and figuring out how to show other people not to make those same mistakes.\"\n\nTRUMP COMMUTES SENTENCE OF ALICE JOHNSON, WOMAN SERVING LIFE-TERM FOR DRUG OFFENSES, AFTER MEETING WITH KARDASHIAN\n\nKushner insisted that day-to-day White House operations aren't affected by what he called media \"noise,\" and pointed to the news that the U.S. this week became a net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years.\n\n\"Nobody really saw a lot of these numbers coming, in terms of the oil exports and how we were going to make America an energy-independent country, but we\u2019ve accomplished that, and that\u2019s been through a lot of great work of a lot of the Cabinet secretaries, but really the leadership of the president, to make that happen,\" he said.\n\nAfter thanking outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly for his \"great service this administration,\" Kushner discussed the various personnel shake-ups in the Trump administration.\n\n\"We just brought in a new White House Counsel today who just started, who is going to be fabulous,\" Kushner said, referring to Pat Cipollone, who is taking over as the Trump administration's top lawyer as multiple reports and indications suggest Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe is winding down.\n\nCipollone, replacing outgoing White House Counsel Don McGahn, also will oversee the president's federal judicial nominees and ethics investigations into the administration -- including a possible probe by House Democrats into the use of a private email service by both Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump.\n\nKushner additionally praised Trump's nomination of prominent lawyer William Barr to become attorney general again. Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush from 1991 to 1992, has drawn criticism from Democrats who pointed to reports he was under consideration to become Trump's personal lawyer and argued he would not be impartial.\n\n\"The president just announced his pick for attorney general, who will be quite good as well from what I\u2019m seeing. Right now in the White House, we have a lot of good people who are just working along,\" Kushner told Sean Hannity.\n\nResponding to the news that, despite expectations, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers will not replace outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Kushner suggested Trump is focusing on finding a good personality fit.\n\nMEADOWS 'FAVORABLY INCLINED' TO DISCUSS CHIEF OF STAFF JOB WITH TRUMP\n\n\"The president will make the right choice for chief of staff when he is ready,\" Kushner said. \"And, hopefully he\u2019ll choose someone he\u2019s got great chemistry with, a great relationship with, who will help him navigate the next couple of years, with all the good opportunities that will emerge, to keep pushing forward.\"\n\nKushner, who came under fire Monday after a New York Times report that he continued to have conversations with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman even after the apparent murder of dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi, told Hannity the focus should be on broader U.S. interests in the Middle East.\n\nKhashoggi, who opposed Saudi Arabia's military intervention against Iranian-backed forces in Yemen, disappeared after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in early October. The CIA reportedly has concluded he was murdered inside, and Turkish officials have said more than a dozen people linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi intelligence entered and departed the country shortly before and after Khashoggi's death.\n\nGRAHAM CALLS FOR TOUGH ACTION ON SAUDI ARABIA, SAYS ITS MILITARY COULDN'T FIGHT ITS WAY OUTSIDE A 'PAPER BAG'\n\n\"I think our intelligence agencies are making their assessments, and we\u2019re hoping to make sure that there\u2019s justice brought where that should be,\" Kushner said.\n\nIn an equivocal statement last month highlighting the complexities of U.S. interests in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia's role in advancing America's agenda there, Trump indicated it was not clear in his mind whether the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's death.\n\n\"We\u2019re focused now on the broader region, which is, which is figuring out how to hopefully bring a deal together between the Israelis and the Palestinians; that conflict has gone on for way too long,\" Kushner said. \"The president\u2019s been very focused on trying to bring all the different parties together and we\u2019re hopeful, in the next couple of months we\u2019ll put out our plan, which again, not every side is going to love, but there\u2019s enough in it and enough reasons why people should take it and move forward.\n\n\"And this plan will keep the Israeli people safe, give them a good future, but also give a real opportunity and hope for the Palestinian people, so that they can live much better lives.\"", "keywords": ["fresh", "lot", "house", "exclusive", "really", "white", "kushner", "interview", "praises", "saudi", "staff", "good", "fabulous", "trump", "counsel", "president", "fox"], "summary": "Roughly 90 percent of prison inmates are held in state facilities and would not be affected by the legislation.\n\"This bill will accomplish a lot to make our communities safer,\" Kushner said.\nThey\u2019ve come up with a bill that we think can really solve a lot of those problems.\nAfter thanking outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly for his \"great service this administration,\" Kushner discussed the various personnel shake-ups in the Trump administration.\nRight now in the White House, we have a lot of good people who are just working along,\" Kushner told Sean Hannity."}, {"link": "https://www.aol.com/article/news/2018/12/09/marco-rubio-pardoning-paul-manafort-would-be-a-mistake/23613389/", "published": "2018-12-09T19:31:31", "title": "Marco Rubio: Pardoning Paul Manafort would be a 'mistake'", "author": ["Aol Staff", "Michael Walsh", "Yahoo News"], "text": "Sen.

He said a presidential pardon in this situation would undercut the very reason for their existence and could result in contentious wrangling over that presidential power granted by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any pardon should be used with relation to these particular cases. Frankly, not only does it not pass the smell test, I think it undermines the reason why we have presidential pardons in the first place,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd I think, in fact, if something like that were to happen, it could trigger a debate about whether the pardon powers should be amended, given these circumstances.\u201d\n\nManafort is a longtime Republican political consultant who advised presidential campaigns for Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bob Dole. Manafort pleaded guilty in September to several charges, including making false statements about his work in Ukraine, financial fraud and obstructing justice. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion, but the allegation that he\u2019s been lying prompted even more speculation that he\u2019s angling for a pardon from Trump.\n\nMore from :\n\nMy secretary of state was 'dumb as a rock,' Trump tweets\n\nFormer President George W.

The President's directive called on CBP to \"take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents.\"\n\nFor years CBP has struggled to maintain its staffing numbers, let alone raise them by thousands.\n\n\"In its first year, CBP's contract with Accenture has already taken longer to deploy and delivered less capability than promised,\" wrote acting Inspector General John V. Kelly.\n\nStacey Jones, a spokeswoman for Accenture, said the company remains \"focused on fulfilling our client's expectations under our contract.\" Jones directed CNN to reach out to CBP for further information regarding their work on the contract.\n\nIssues with the contract come amid the backdrop of Trump's mass deployment of more than 5,000 active duty troops to the US-Mexico border to supplement CBP's staffing and resources.\n\n\"For us, in this country, we keep America safe by proper application of the law,\" a DHS official said in response to the IG report. \"It's a law enforcement mission. It's not a military mission. It's a law enforcement mission.\"\n\nThe inspector general released its report as a \"management alert\" -- reserved for issues that require immediate attention -- after the watchdog received multiple hotline complaints related to the performance and management of the contract.\n\nThe CBP's struggles with retention began around five years ago, when the demographics of illegal border crossings began to shift from single men to families and unaccompanied minors, creating new recruiting challenges for the department, according to a DHS official.\n\nThe official said that the negative press coverage surrounding the unaccompanied minor crisis in 2014 added to the agency's staffing challenges.\n\nThe US Border Patrol, the CBP's law enforcement arm at the US borders, has a statutorily established minimum staffing level of just over 21,370 agents, not including the additional request from the president.\n\nBorder Patrol staffing levels peaked in 2010 with 21,444 agents nationwide, down to 19,555 in 2018.\n\nHowever, there was a net gain of 120 agents in 2018 -- the first year that had had a net gain since 2013, according to CBP data.\n\n\"Hiring is not just anyone that can fill a uniform. It is extremely difficult to be a Border Patrol agent, and so we work really hard to get the right person for the job,\" said the official. \"You want to hire a lot of people, but you cannot reduce the standards.\"\n\nIn order to keep up with retention and hire thousands of new agents and officers, CBP decided it would \"have to start thinking outside the box, get some more innovative ideas,\" said another DHS official.\n\nWhen planning its hiring surge of thousands of additional personnel, CBP was grappling with two issues -- how to build the right kind of hiring capacity and wanting a set of \"fresh set of eyes\" from outside of the government, the DHS official said.\n\n\"When we set this up, we knew that we were trying to be innovative. We were trying to open the aperture and try something new, so, 'how can we in government really attack this problem differently?'\" a DHS official said.\n\nThe inspector general, which initiated its review of the contract in July, found that Accenture was \"nowhere near\" satisfying its goal to hire 7,500 people over the next five years. And the internal watchdog concluded that CBP has \"used significant staffing and resources\" to help Accenture do its job.\n\n\"As such, we are concerned that CBP may have paid Accenture for services and tools not provided,\" the inspector general wrote.\n\nAdditionally, the company claimed it would have the capability and capacity to perform all steps in the CBP hiring process with 90 days of the contract, but the company \"has yet to demonstrate\" an efficient or effective process, the inspector general found.\n\nAbout a week ago, the CBP told Accenture to stop processing applications and think about the activities \"where the return on investment really is positive,\" a DHS official said.\n\nSome steps in the hiring process are required to be done by a government official, such as the final decision on an offer, so it was necessary for Accenture to hand candidates back to the government for parts of the process, according to a DHS official. Officials found that the handoffs between the government and the private contractor became tedious and time consuming. And in the meantime, the government hiring center got to the point where it could handle the current applicant capacity, a DHS official said.\n\nHowever, CBP was satisfied with Accenture's digital marketing and advertising assistance as well as with the applicant care and support it provided, such as making phone calls to applicants during the process.\n\n\"We have more work to do here. We have more work to do in terms of figuring out exactly how we are going to do this with Accenture going forward,\" said the official.\n\nAccenture also came under internal fire last month, when an employee petition circulated urging the company to cancel its contract with the Trump administration, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"The technology we provide is sold in the name of efficiency, but all we see is technology supercharging inhumane and cruel policies,\" the petition stated, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAccenture's Jones said, \"we welcome the feedback from our people and are aware of the posting on our internal blog site. An important part of our culture is that we encourage all our people to have a dialogue about issues that arise in the workplace and beyond.\"\n\nOther technology companies have faced similar internal backlash, often over the administration's immigration and border policies.\n\nThe CBP concurred with all of the recommendations made by the inspector general, although it disagreed with some of the watchdog's conclusions.\n\n\"They raised issues and concerns that we ourselves had, that we're managing, and that's why we concurred with all their recommendations,\" said a DHS official.\n\nDespite the ups and downs with the contract, CBP has lowered the average time it takes to get an applicant hired from more than a year to nine months, according to a DHS official.\n\nCBP is also starting to see evidence that the way it is targeting applicants is \"getting a higher percentage of applicants who are qualified to get through the system,\" the official said.\n\nThere were times when CBP had to have 200 applicants to produce one Border Patrol agent, but the number of applicants is down to about 75 for each hire, according to the official.\n\nAdditionally, in last couple months, the number of applicants per month has gone up even though it's a time of year when the number typically goes down, the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Accenture.", "keywords": ["issues", "dhs", "protection", "contract", "hiring", "general", "official", "border", "internal", "cbp", "customs", "accenture", "according", "inspector", "serious", "watchdog"], "summary": "(CNN) A US Customs and Border Protection hiring contract with a consulting firm was riddled with performance issues over the past year, including an inability of the firm to process quality candidates and provide promised technology, according to internal watchdog findings released Monday.\n\"In its first year, CBP's contract with Accenture has already taken longer to deploy and delivered less capability than promised,\" wrote acting Inspector General John V.

This year's turnout was 8 points higher than the previous ceiling.\n\nIf we look only at the raw number, remember that turnout in the 2014 midterm was only a little more than 83 million. This year, about 35 million more people turned out to vote.\n\nThe turnout is even more amazing is when you expand out the timeframe. The 50.1% turnout is higher than for any midterm in the last 100 years. This despite the fact that many of those elections took place when those under 21 were not eligible to vote. Remember, those younger than 21 are the least likely to vote, so you'd expect that the the turnout rate of eligible voters would have been higher before the youngest were eligible (in years such as 2018).\n\nIndeed, the turnout in 2018 is actually more comparable to presidential elections than midterms. The 50.1% turnout is closer to the average presidential turnout (56.5%) than midterm turnout (39.4%) since the 26th Amendment was enacted and it nearly exceeds the turnout in the 1988 election (52.8%) and 1996 election (51.7%).\n\nNow you might be wondering which side benefited from the high 2018 turnout. That's not as clear as you might think. It will become clearer through examination of voter files in the coming months.\n\nFor now, we do know from pre-election polling that Democrats were generally doing as well among registered voters as they were among likely voters. That's very different from 2010 or 2014, when Democrats were doing considerably worse among likely voters than among all registered voters. So higher Democratic turnout in 2018 was certainly beneficial to Democrats.\n\nAn examination of 2018 turnout patterns by congressional district compared to 2016 suggests that turnout fell the most in areas in which fewer people have college degrees and in which more people live in rural areas. Again, both of those would have been good for Democrats.\n\nYet, it's also conceivable that Democrats might have done better if turnout was lower. We saw in a number of the special elections in 2017 and 2018 this exact phenomenon taking place . Democrats scored surprisingly well in special elections with low turnout such as Kansas' 4th district and South Carolina's 5th district. When turnout went up in the midterm election, Republicans regained their usual dominance in those districts\n\nWhen looking at how well House Democrats did compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016, the difference across districts between the Democrats' performance in 2018 vs. Clinton in 2016 is not correlated by how high turnout was.\n\nWhat does seem likely from pre-election polling is that the increase in turnout overall was Trump driven. According to Gallup and the Pew Research Center , 60% of voters said said their vote was intended to send a message to the President (in this case Trump). That's higher than in any midterm election since 1982 (when the question was first asked).\n\nWith Trump likely to be on the ballot in 2020, don't be surprised if that election also features high turnout. Like for 2018, it's not clear who high turnout might benefit in 2020. It's really a matter of who turns out.", "keywords": ["insane", "voters", "turnout", "trump", "democrats", "likely", "election", "midterm", "turned", "higher", "vote", "2018", "elections"], "summary": "(CNN) President Donald Trump solved a problem that no other president before him could: Getting people to vote in a midterm election.\nNow you might be wondering which side benefited from the high 2018 turnout.\nThat's very different from 2010 or 2014, when Democrats were doing considerably worse among likely voters than among all registered voters.\nThat's higher than in any midterm election since 1982 (when the question was first asked).\nWith Trump likely to be on the ballot in 2020, don't be surprised if that election also features high turnout."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dems-demand-answers-about-bill-shines-relationship-with-fox-news", "published": "2018-12-11T01:27:00", "title": "Democrats demand answers on Bill Shine's continuing Fox News bonuses", "author": [], "text": "Democratic senators are pressing the White House on whether its top communications aide is cleared to work for the administration while he continues to receive bonuses and options from his old employer, 21st Century Fox.\n\nSens.

But steer clear of this temptation \u2014 eating or tasting unbaked products that are intended to be cooked, such as dough or batter, can make you sick.\"\n\nThe CDC goes on to explain that uncooked flour could contain e coli bacteria and that raw eggs pose a risk of getting sick from salmonella. On the surface, those sound pretty bad. That said, it's important to put things in perspective. Sure, eating cookie dough can make you sick \u2014 but it probably won't.\n\nIt's estimated that only about 1 in 20,000 eggs contain salmonella. Bakers wishing to eliminate such risk could theoretically use pasteurized eggs (though that may mean sacrificing taste).\n\nAs far as flour, yes, there was an e coli outbreak in 2016 tied to flour that is believed to have caused 63 people to get sick, and it led to a General Mills flour recall. But that this is not a common occurrence, and even taking it into account, it's a relatively small number given that Americans consume over 130 pounds of wheat flour per capita each year.\n\nSure, it's theoretically possible that a batch of cookie dough you make could contain relatively rare infected eggs or flour, but Americans routinely engage in behaviors that carry risks. Adults and their kids ride bikes, ski, play sports, eat at restaurants whose kitchens they haven't thoroughly vetted, and so on. They determine ultimately that the fun is worth the risk, so why shouldn't the same logic apply to cookie dough?\n\nThere's also an issue of degree. If you routinely make large bowls of cookie dough purely for the purpose of consuming it raw, it will increase your odds of getting sick. But if, like most people, you make a batch of cookies and lick some raw leftover dough off of the spoon, the risk of getting sick is statistically low.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees. Sure, if you're a generally a risk-averse person, you may decide to err on the side of avoiding consuming raw dough and keep it from your children. But if you decide to indulge in some cookie dough while baking, you shouldn't feel guilty \u2014 you will more likely than not be fine.", "keywords": ["probably", "dough", "worth", "eggs", "contain", "cookie", "flour", "sick", "raw", "eating", "getting", "risk"], "summary": "But the truth is that eating raw cookie dough is probably worth the risk for most people.\nSure, eating cookie dough can make you sick \u2014 but it probably won't.\nThey determine ultimately that the fun is worth the risk, so why shouldn't the same logic apply to cookie dough?\nSure, if you're a generally a risk-averse person, you may decide to err on the side of avoiding consuming raw dough and keep it from your children.\nBut if you decide to indulge in some cookie dough while baking, you shouldn't feel guilty \u2014 you will more likely than not be fine."}, {"link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/420666-cases-of-polio-like-illness-hit-record-high", "published": "2018-12-10T23:03:24", "title": "Cases of polio-like illness hit record high", "author": [], "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a record number of cases of a polio-like illness in 2018.\n\nSo far this year, the CDC has confirmed 158 cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like illness that primarily strikes children.

Coleman"], "text": "Anderson Cooper, reporting for CBS\u2019s long-running \u201cnewsmagazine\u201d 60 Minutes, has dished on new data about screen time and the brain changes it triggers in children. On a protracted segment, the silver fox showed the MRI scans that prove extended exposure to screens and digital entertainment is altering the minds of kids. Those scans come from children enrolling in the National Institute of Health\u2019s first major longitudinal study of the effects of screen time, drugs and sports injuries on kid neurology. And it all sounded like a very big deal. Unfortunately, the report, which reached an audience of millions, didn\u2019t dwell on the small stuff.\n\nThis is not to say that the report was precisely wrong, but that the vector of reporting \u2014 the notion that brains might be changed by exposure to screens \u2014 overwhelmed the facts of the story to such a degree that it was hard to focus on what the researchers were actually saying. Dr. Gaya Dowling of the National Institutes of Health told Cooper, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being caused by the screen time. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d but the implication of the reportage remained clear.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt makes sense that Cooper and 60 Minutes are leaning into screen time reporting. As screens proliferate, parents are becoming more anxious about the hours kids spend in the blue glow of their TVs and tablets. At the same time, researchers are sounding the alarm. Some even say that screen time is this generation\u2019s smoking: a seemingly harmless activity that will turn out to have dire long-term consequences. There is science to support an addiction metaphor. Some kids who spend more than two hours a day with screens score lower on \u201cthinking and learning\u201d tests.\n\nUnfortunately, it remains unclear precisely what this means. Why? Because science takes time. Dr. Dowling can offer data, but is reticent to offer firm conclusions for good reason: We don\u2019t have the information to support them. What does that mean for parents? Essentially that they have, in queueing up Netflix, made their kids part of a culture-wide experiment in childhood screen exposure. It could go well! It could also go very badly. It\u2019s hard to say.\n\nFeatured Video Loading Video Content Watch more Fatherly Subscribe\n\nThe fact that toddlers don\u2019t want to give back a tablet playing wildly interactive apps is interesting, but there\u2019s not a definitive best practice to be pulled from the wreckage of that observation. Discovering that a bunch of college students felt better about their life after limiting social media time to 30 minutes a day is great but doesn\u2019t offer many insights to parents. And sure, it\u2019s quite possible that screen time will change a child\u2019s brain. But do you know what else will? Literally everything.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne researcher Cooper spoke with correlated the rise of cell phones with the rise of teen depression since the late 1990s. Okay. That\u2019s really interesting and there might be something there. However, that\u2019s not causation. It remains possible that life for teens has just gotten more depressing.\n\nPart of the problem with the data on screen time is that there haven\u2019t been any good longitudinal studies that show the effects of screen time over time. That\u2019s important. And that\u2019s why the NIH study is legitimately newsworthy. But even when the results from the study are in, sometime in the next decade, the data is unlikely to offer clear-cut solutions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShould parents pay attention to the data? Absolutely. It\u2019s important to make parenting decisions in the most informed way possible. But it\u2019s also important to know what you know and to know what you don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know that children\u2019s brains are being reshaped by screen time. We also don\u2019t know that their brains are not being reshaped by screen time.

Anyone who hasn\u2019t gotten vaccinated is urged not to wait until an outbreak, because it takes two weeks for maximum protection to develop.\n\n\u201cThis is a good opportunity to be vaccinated so it\u2019s on board and in effect by the time the stories are: \u2018Now there\u2019s lots of flu,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Luther Rhodes, chief of hospital infection control and epidemiology for Lehigh Valley Health Network.\n\nFlu-related deaths usually number between 3,000 and 49,000 per year across the United States, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. During the 2017-18 season, the number of deaths was closer to 80,000.\n\nPhysicians say the message is getting out on the importance of flu shots to groups at highest risk for severe complications: the very young, very old and those with other medical problems.\n\nBut there is that age group between about 25 and 45 who forego getting vaccinated. Maybe they got a shot once and still got sick, though that might have been a cold or the vaccine\u2019s protection had yet to kick in.\n\nThose who do get the flu can have symptoms such as a lingering cough for weeks, and can be forced to miss work or school with a fever that can last a week. Some flu sufferers develop pneumonia to the point they need medical assistance getting oxygen into their blood.\n\nThose infected with flu are contagious for about a day before symptoms begin.\n\n\u201cYou do this not just for yourself but you do it for others,\u201d Jahre said. \"That\u2019s the message we want to get across.\n\n\"At the very least, anybody who gets the flu, you know you feel like you've been basically run over by a truck.\"\n\nPennsylvania and New Jersey were seeking local influenza activity as of the week ending Dec. 1, 2018, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Courtesy image\n\nRhodes described flu activity so far this season as light in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania and across the Eastern seaboard. Local health-care providers will sometimes see a spike in flu cases right after Thanksgiving break among students returning to the Lehigh Valley\u2019s colleges and universities from visits to home, where they might have been exposed, he said.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened this year, which is good news, he said.\n\n\u201cBut again, flu is always, it\u2019s a viral condition, well-known to be spring-loaded to emerge at any time and oftentimes with little to no warning you have a sharp increase in the number of cases,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThere is flu, but it\u2019s barely a blip on the radar map locally and that matches the national picture, but every week we go into the cold months is a couple inches or notches closer to suddenly a widespread outbreak.\u201d\n\nMore good news is there are no red flags that this season\u2019s flu vaccine formula is a poor fit for the flu strains circulating. Supplies of vaccine are plentiful, and it\u2019s available at outpatient clinics, doctor\u2019s offices and pharmacies. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a \u201cFlu Vaccine Finder\u201d widget on its website near your ZIP code.\n\nThis year\u2019s quadrivalent vaccine protects against two Influenza A viruses and two Influenza B strains, while the trivalent formulation protects against the same two As and one of the Bs. It\u2019s available in a nasal mist for children and in a high-dose version for people ages 65 and older that, despite its name, doesn\u2019t come with a higher risk of side effects, according to Rhodes.\n\n\u201cI wish there\u2019d be a better term for it,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThe reason that there is a high dose is because it works better in individuals 65 and above.\u201d\n\nThe flu hospitalizations that St. Luke\u2019s has seen so far this season were all for Influenza A, said Jahre, which matches the national trend on flu strains circulating. In Pennsylvania, Lehigh and Chester counties have been seeing the most positive tests for flu, he said. In 2017-18, Northampton County was among the counties hardest-hit by flu.\n\nThese 15 Pa. counties had it the worst last flu season\n\nLehigh Valley Health Network this season is also seeing more cases than normal of RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. That is a flu-like infection that most often affects infants and young children and older adults.\n\n\u201cOur attack rate here, the number of cases, is as busy as we are in the middle of flu season,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBut this has been a particularly nasty year.\u201d\n\nThe advice for avoiding RSV is similar to that for avoiding the flu, with the exception that there is no vaccine for RSV. Medical professionals advise:\n\nWash you hands often.\n\nAvoid close contact with sick people.\n\nAvoid touching your face with unwashed hands.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nStay home when you\u2019re sick.\n\nClean and disinfect surfaces.\n\nKurt Bresswein may be reached at kbresswein@lehighvalleylive.com.

This is very encouraging, but with the severity of this year\u2019s flu virus being clear for us, we encourage even more people to get their free vaccine,\u201d said Dr Al Khal.\n\nInfluenza is a serious disease; it can lead to hospitalization and, if complications arise, sometimes even death, as Dr Muna Al Maslamani, Medical Director of HMC\u2019s Communicable Disease Center said. \u201cEvery year, millions of people around the world get the flu and millions are hospitalized as a result of it, while hundreds of thousands end up dying from flu-related complications. Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at high risk for the flu and its complications. This includes the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and people with chronic medical conditions,\u201d said Dr Al Maslamani.\n\nTo ensure as many people as possible are vaccinated this year, members of the public can get the influenza vaccine for free at all PHCC health centers across the country, as well as at more than 35 private clinics.\n\n\u201cPrimary Health Care Corporation is committed to protecting the health of Qatar\u2019s population and providing the flu vaccine free to all Qatar\u2019s residents with a valid health card is just one way in which we can do this,\u2019\u2019 said Dr Khalid Hamid Elawad, Health Protection Manager, Preventive Health Department at PHCC.\n\n\u201cAcross our 26 health centers, we are currently vaccinating around 4,000 people a week against seasonal influenza. There are three simple ways to receive your flu vaccine from the health center you are registered at: you can ask for the vaccine during an existing appointment, schedule a flu vaccination appointment by calling PHCC on 107, or simply drop in to your health center without an appointment and receive your vaccine swiftly,\u2019\u2019 Dr Elawad added.\n\nFor more information about influenza and where to get the vaccine for free in Qatar, go to www.stoptheflu.qa", "keywords": ["number", "free", "virus", "dr", "vaccine", "medical", "seasonal", "health", "increase", "al", "influenza", "flu"], "summary": "The PeninsulaRecent national data on this year\u2019s seasonal influenza virus shows three times as many people have tested positive for the flu in October and November, compared to the same period in 2017.\n\u201cThroughout October and November there have been more than 6,800 respiratory samples testing positive for the flu virus.\nThis includes the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and people with chronic medical conditions,\u201d said Dr Al Maslamani.\n\u201cAcross our 26 health centers, we are currently vaccinating around 4,000 people a week against seasonal influenza.\nFor more information about influenza and where to get the vaccine for free in Qatar, go to www.stoptheflu.qa"}, {"link": "https://6abc.com/health/new-study-suggests-birth-months-may-be-linked-to-adhd/4873735/", "published": "2018-12-10T20:20:00", "title": "Birth months may be linked to high risk of ADHD in young children", "author": [], "text": "A recent study suggests children born in August are more likely than children in other months to be diagnosed and treated for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.In most states, kids born in August are usually the youngest in their classrooms.Sometimes, these children are nearly a year younger than some classmates, which researchers say could be part of the problem.Health experts say this study confirms on a larger scale what some other studies have shown on smaller ones.But it doesn't account for how kids were diagnosed or if their physicians were following the right protocols to properly diagnose them for ADHD.-----", "keywords": ["high", "linked", "adhd", "months", "say", "young", "youngest", "children", "diagnosed", "birth", "kids", "treated", "study", "usually", "born", "risk", "younger"], "summary": "A recent study suggests children born in August are more likely than children in other months to be diagnosed and treated for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.In most states, kids born in August are usually the youngest in their classrooms.Sometimes, these children are nearly a year younger than some classmates, which researchers say could be part of the problem.Health experts say this study confirms on a larger scale what some other studies have shown on smaller ones.But it doesn't account for how kids were diagnosed or if their physicians were following the right protocols to properly diagnose them for ADHD.-----"}, {"link": "https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/medical-mystery-patient-coughs-up-intact-blood-clot-of-bronchial-tree-12-10-2018", "published": "2018-12-10T15:35:05", "title": "Medical Mystery: Patient coughs up intact blood clot of bronchial tree", "author": ["Adrian Mojica", "Wztv Staff"], "text": "WARNING: Images might be consider too graphic for some viewers.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.

Currently, there is no way to halt its progress, but clinical trials of new drugs are underway. What approach will serve specialists best?\n\n\n\nA new review of clinical trials advises on the best way forward. A new review of clinical trials advises on the best way forward.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people around the world live with dementia, and approximately 60\u201370 percent have Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is aging, and people ages 65 or older are the most vulnerable.\n\nCurrent treatments for this condition address its symptoms, such as memory loss and behavioral changes. However, more and more research aims to find a therapy that will tackle the biological changes that characterize Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBut are researchers on the right track with their investigations, and what would be the best treatment approach? A new comprehensive review published in the journal Neurology, and available online, addresses these questions.\n\nMost trials target brain pathologies\n\nIn the review, specialists from the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation in New York, NY analyze current clinical trials for dementia drugs and advise about the best approach going forward.\n\n\"Alzheimer's is a complex disease with many different factors that contribute to its onset and progression,\" explains Dr. Howard Fillit, the review's senior author.\n\n\"Decades of research have revealed common processes that are relevant to understanding why the aging brain is vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. New therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease will come from this understanding of the effects of aging on the brain.\" Dr. Howard Fillit\n\nBecause current therapies for Alzheimer's focus on symptom management, but not on stopping the condition in its tracks, recent research has looked into attacking the Alzheimer's mechanism, particularly in the brain.\n\nOne key characteristic of this condition is the buildup of toxic proteins, such as beta-amyloid and tau, which form plaques that interfere with communication between brain cells.\n\nThus, as the new review points out, many studies have focused on developing drugs that would effectively target beta-amyloid and tau.\n\nIn fact, such experimental drugs dominate the landscape of phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer's treatments, with 52 percent of them testing drugs that interact with the two proteins.\n\nStill, as Dr. Fillit notes, \"It is currently not known if these classic pathologies (amyloid and tau) represent valid drug targets and if these targets alone are sufficient to treat Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nThe reviewers observe that therapies targeting beta-amyloid and tau proteins have not, so far, been able to significantly slow down the development of Alzheimer's, but that the trials have offered more important clues about the condition's mechanisms.\n\nCombination therapy most likely to succeed\n\nAlthough most trials have focused on drugs that target changes in the brain, the review's authors note that a few trials in earlier phases (phases I or II) have been looking into other strategies, particularly ones that target aging processes that may exacerbate Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Targeting the common biological processes of aging may be an effective approach to developing therapies to prevent or delay age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's,\" Dr. Fillit says.\n\nThese processes include:\n\nlow-grade, chronic inflammation, which is associated with thinning layers of the cerebral cortex and poor blood flow to the brain \u2014 both of which can impact cognitive function\n\nmetabolic dysfunctions that can lead to cellular damage in the brain\n\nvascular dysfunction, which can be associated with cognitive problems because it can mean that the brain does not receive enough blood, and thus may lack oxygen\n\nchanges in gene regulation that may contribute to Alzheimer's mechanisms\n\na loss of synapses, the connecting points between neurons, which allow information to flow between brain cells\n\nDr. Fillit believes that \"Our success in fighting Alzheimer's disease will likely come from combination therapy \u2014 finding drugs that have positive effects on the malfunctions that happen as people age.\"\n\nBy developing a series of drugs that each targets one of these key processes, specialists will see more success in halting the progress of Alzheimer's, the authors argue.\n\n\"Combination therapies are the standard of care for other major diseases of aging, such as heart disease, cancer, and hypertension, and will likely be necessary in treating Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,\" adds Dr. Fillit.", "keywords": ["alzheimers", "review", "therapy", "trials", "dr", "future", "approach", "drugs", "brain", "disease", "aging", "processes", "best", "fillit"], "summary": "Millions of people worldwide live with a form of dementia, the most common of which is Alzheimer's disease.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people around the world live with dementia, and approximately 60\u201370 percent have Alzheimer's disease.\nThe greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is aging, and people ages 65 or older are the most vulnerable.\nHowever, more and more research aims to find a therapy that will tackle the biological changes that characterize Alzheimer's disease.\n\"Decades of research have revealed common processes that are relevant to understanding why the aging brain is vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease."}, {"link": "https://kfor.com/2018/12/09/man-dying-from-heart-failure-coughs-up-blood-clot-shaped-like-lung-passage/", "published": "2018-12-09T17:48:00", "title": "California man dying from heart failure coughs up blood clot shaped like lung passage", "author": ["Nadia Judith Enchassi", "Tribune Media Wire"], "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. \u2013 A 36-year-old California man has died after suffering from chronic heart failure and coughing so severely that he spit out a bright red blood clot perfectly-shaped like the airway passages of his right lung\u2019s bronchial tree.\n\nThe unidentified patient was receiving treatment in the intensive care unit at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, according to a November 29 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nA 36-year-old man was admitted to the ICU with an acute exacerbation of chronic #heartfailure.

Other women won\u2019t have chest pain at all, she adds.\n\n\u201cWomen are far more likely to develop atypical symptoms for a heart attack,\u201d Haythe says, including nausea, vomiting, indigestion, shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, and arm, neck and back pain. Sanjiv Patel, MD, cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif., tells Yahoo Lifestyle there are ways to distinguish if the pain is heart-related. \u201cIf you have pain and it gets worse when you exert yourself, that\u2019s more likely to be a sign of a cardiac issue,\u201d Patel says. \u201cIf you have pain and difficulty breathing when you\u2019re sitting and watching TV, you get up and walk around and it goes away, the pain is probably not related to your heart.\u201d\n\nHow often it happens also matters, Patel says. If you have a minute or two of discomfort but it goes away and doesn\u2019t happen again for several weeks, it\u2019s probably not something to be alarmed about, he says. \u201cBut if you do something and it gets worse, and it comes back the next day for a longer period of time, you\u2019ll want to see a doctor,\u201d he says.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s \u201cunclear\u201d why women tend to experience heart attacks differently from men, Haythe says. \u201cThere are a few hypotheses,\u201d Wider says. \u201cIt could have to do with a difference in pain thresholds between men and women \u2014 women often blow off the symptoms because they are more subtle and less recognizable. It may also have to do with hormones.\u201d The size and pumping ability of the right side of the heart is different in men versus women, she adds. \u201cThe right ventricle is larger in men, which may play a role in the difference in symptoms,\u201d Wider says.\n\nIf you\u2019re having unusual symptoms, Haythe says it\u2019s important to get checked out right away. \u201cAny new symptoms that don\u2019t feel quite right should prompt an immediate call or visit to your doctor,\u201d she says. \u201cTake your body seriously.

Overall, almost 88,000, or about 23 percent, had at least three insurance claims for test strips used to check blood sugar at home.\n\nMore than half of the people testing their blood sugar at home didn\u2019t need to do this, accounting for 14 percent of the total study population, researchers reported in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cMany type 2 diabetes patients not using insulin or other medications at risk of rapid changes in blood sugar levels are testing far more often then they need to be,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Kevin Platt of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\n\u201cThis needless behavior causes unnecessary pokes, worry, and costs,\u201d Platt said by email. \u201cMore is not always better when it comes to medical care.\u201d\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, is linked to obesity and aging and happens when the body can\u2019t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Left untreated, it can lead to complications like blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and amputations.\n\nMany patients can keep their blood sugar in a healthy range with oral medications and don\u2019t need insulin. Unlike insulin, which immediately affects blood sugar and requires regular testing to ensure blood sugar is in a healthy range, most pills for diabetes don\u2019t require regular testing because they don\u2019t cause rapid shifts in blood sugar, Platt said.\n\nAmong people in the study who appeared to be needlessly testing blood sugar at home, about 33,000 individuals were taking medications that aren\u2019t known to cause dangerously low blood sugar and another 19,000 were not taking any diabetes medicines at all.\n\nHalf of the patients doing unnecessary blood sugar tests at home did these tests at least twice a day, and half of them had testing supply costs of at least $325 a year, the study found.\n\nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how home testing directly impacted blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.\n\nAnd some patients might still need to test at home, even if they don\u2019t need to do this multiple times daily, said Sheri Colberg a professor emerita at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, who has studied and treated people with diabetes.\n\n\u201cEven if checking routinely may not change outcomes like overall blood glucose management, the benefit of having glucose testing strips available is that individuals - even non-insulin users - are then able to check their blood glucose when their usual routines vary, during times of illness, or whenever other events may negatively impact their blood glucose,\u201d Colberg, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\nPatients should discuss their home blood sugar testing needs at every checkup, advised Dr. Vanessa Arguello of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cDiabetic patients who are using insulin or are on oral medications that may cause low blood sugars should monitor their blood sugars multiple times per day including before meals, at bedtime, occasionally after meals to learn about nutrition therapy, prior to critical tasks, and when they suspect low blood sugars,\u201d Arguello said by email.\n\nDiabetic patients who are not using insulin or are not taking medications that may cause low blood sugars can monitor their blood sugars less frequent from twice daily to every other day based on their diabetes goals established by the individual and their physician,\u201d Arguello added.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2UvbqgE JAMA Internal Medicine, online December 10, 2018.", "keywords": ["insulin", "study", "sugar", "needlessly", "diabetes", "need", "medications", "diabetics", "testing", "dont", "blood", "patients", "test"], "summary": "REUTERS/BeawihartaPeople with type 2 diabetes don\u2019t need to test their blood at home if they have well controlled symptoms and don\u2019t take medications that can cause dangerously low blood sugar, doctors say.\nFor these patients, studies have not found that home blood sugar monitoring makes any difference in blood sugar levels.\nOverall, almost 88,000, or about 23 percent, had at least three insurance claims for test strips used to check blood sugar at home.\nMany patients can keep their blood sugar in a healthy range with oral medications and don\u2019t need insulin.\nUnlike insulin, which immediately affects blood sugar and requires regular testing to ensure blood sugar is in a healthy range, most pills for diabetes don\u2019t require regular testing because they don\u2019t cause rapid shifts in blood sugar, Platt said."}, {"link": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6480519/Statins-safe-patients-shouldnt-stop-taking-drugs.html", "published": "2018-12-10T18:41:00", "title": "Statins ARE safe and patients shouldn't stop taking the drugs", "author": ["Mia De Graaf Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "text": "Don't rush to quit or avoid statins, the American Heart Association says in a statement responding to fears the drug carries undiscussed risks.\n\nResearch published last week sparked uproar: scientists in Zurich found the drug's benefits only outweigh the risks for people with a very high heart attack risk.\n\nThe study suggested half of users should not be taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs.\n\nBut today, America's top cardiologists urged caution, clarifying that there is little evidence of side effects from statins and a wealth of research showing the pills save lives.\n\nAnyone concerned by the Swiss study should speak to their doctor before making a rash, potentially life-threatening decision, the statement said.\n\nResearch published last week sparked uproar: Swiss scientists found the benefits only outweigh the risks for people with a very high heart attack risk. But the AHA says: take the study with a pinch of salt\n\n'In most cases, you should not stop taking your statin medication if you think you are having side effects from the drug - instead, talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns,' said Mark Creager, MD former president of the American Heart Association.\n\n'Stopping a statin can significantly increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke caused by a blocked artery.'\n\nThe statement was based on a review of a plethora of studies evaluating the safety and side effects of the widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs, is scheduled for publication in the journal Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.\n\n'For consumers, the message is that the benefits of statins well outweigh the risk of important harms,' said statement coauthor Dr. Larry Goldstein, Ruth L. Works Professor and chairman of the department of neurology and co-director of the Kentucky Neuroscience Institute KY Clinic at the University of Kentucky.\n\nPatients 'should discuss the reasons for taking statins and any concerns about risks with their health care provider.'\n\nCurrently, one in four Americans over age 40 takes a statin drug, Goldstein and his colleagues noted. But as many as 10 percent stop taking statins because of symptoms they fear are caused by the medications.\n\nThe authors urge patients to see a health care provider before quitting statins because of presumed side effects, except in the case of one type of symptom: dark urine the color of cola or coffee.\n\nThat symptom can be the sign of the rare, but dangerous, side effect called rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle fibers break down rapidly. The condition can result in acute kidney failure.\n\nRhabdomyolysis is seen in fewer than one in 1,000 patients taking statin therapy, Goldstein and his coauthors reported.\n\nThe other serious side effect is severe liver damage, which the authors reported occurred in about one in 100,000 patients taking statins.\n\n'Routine tests of muscle and liver function are not recommended,' Goldstein said in an email. 'An assessment of muscle symptoms and other medications that can affect the muscles is recommended as a baseline.'\n\nMost muscle aches and pains in people taking statins 'are not serious and are not necessarily caused by statins,' Goldstein said.\n\n'These symptoms are more likely to be statin related if they affect both sides of the body and the thigh and shoulder muscles and occur within the first few weeks or months of starting treatment.'\n\nFor statin users worried about muscle pains and aches, blood tests to measure creatine kinase levels can confirm or rule out rhabdomyolysis.\n\n'Severe liver impairment is very rare,' Goldstein said. 'Symptoms can include skin and eyes becoming yellow, dark urine, abdominal pain, itchy skin, pale stool and bruising.'\n\nThe researchers also determined that statins could raise the risk of diabetes - but only in people who were likely to develop the disease anyway, based on their risk factors.\n\nThe risk for bleeding in the brain was not increased with statin use, except in those who had already had a stroke.\n\nHowever, the authors found 'no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between statins and cancer, cataracts, cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, or tendonitis.'\n\nWhile there can be side effects, even rare serious ones, patients should ask, 'What is the 'side effect' of not taking statins?' It's a 25 to 50 percent increased risk of having a heart attack, a stroke or a premature cardiovascular death,' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the new article.\n\nWith respect to one of the more serious side effects - rhabdomyolysis - it's even more rare than the new statement suggests, if you look only at patients without heart disease who are taking statins to lower cholesterol as a preventive measure, said Fonarow. In those patients, the risk 'is more like one in 50,000 or 100,000,' he added.\n\nStatins are among the 'very few medications invented in the modern era that save lives,' said Dr. Omar Ali, medical director of Cardiac Cath Lab at Harper University Hospital at the Detroit Medical Center.\n\n'For the appropriate patients, taking statins for primary prevention saves lives and even in secondary prevention statins save lives,' said Ali, who was not involved with the new article.\n\n'The most important thing is to be in direct consultation with a cardiologist or primary care physician, so if you start experiencing any of the side effects, you can get in touch with your doctor sooner and get the appropriate care.'", "keywords": ["statin", "statins", "safe", "statement", "stop", "drugs", "muscle", "shouldnt", "effects", "taking", "risk", "goldstein", "heart", "patients"], "summary": "But as many as 10 percent stop taking statins because of symptoms they fear are caused by the medications.\nRhabdomyolysis is seen in fewer than one in 1,000 patients taking statin therapy, Goldstein and his coauthors reported.\nThe other serious side effect is severe liver damage, which the authors reported occurred in about one in 100,000 patients taking statins.\nMost muscle aches and pains in people taking statins 'are not serious and are not necessarily caused by statins,' Goldstein said.\n'For the appropriate patients, taking statins for primary prevention saves lives and even in secondary prevention statins save lives,' said Ali, who was not involved with the new article."}, {"link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/as-opioids-become-taboo-doctors-taper-down-or-abandon-pain-patients-driving-many-to-suicide", "published": "2018-12-10T16:54:39", "title": "As doctors taper or end opioid prescriptions, many patients driven to despair, suicide", "author": ["Elizabeth Llorente", "Dr. Thomas Kline", "Former Harvard Medical School Program Administrator", "Publisher Of List Of Pain Patients Who Have Died Suicide.", "Dr. Debbie Dowell", "Lead Author Of The", "Cdc Guideline For Prescribing Opioids For Chronic Pain", "Michael Schatman", "Editor-In-Chief Of The Journal Of Pain", "Cynthia Touissant"], "text": "This is the first of a three-part series on the nation's struggle to address a crippling opioid crisis, and the unintended victims left in its wake.\n\nIt happened slowly. The pain caused by a 1980 back fracture, the result of a tractor-trailer crash, crippled more and more of Jay Lawrence\u2019s body and spirit.\n\nBy 2006, the Tennessee native and Navy veteran\u2019s arms and legs were going numb. The excruciating pain reduced him to tears. Multiple surgeries, chiropractic adjustments, and physical therapy didn\u2019t work.\n\nHe finally found solace in prescription painkillers \u2013 120 milligrams a day of morphine. A high dose, but it dulled the pain enough for him to take walks with his wife, shop for groceries, even take in a few movies.\n\nBut last February, the pain clinic doctor delivered jarring news: He was cutting Lawrence\u2019s daily dosage, first to 90 milligrams then, in short stages, down to 30 milligrams. The doctor said the reduced dosage was in response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prescribing guidelines released in 2016 as part of a national anti-opioid push, according to Lawrence\u2019s wife, Meredith.\n\n\u201cThe doctor said: \u2018You know these guidelines are going to become a law eventually. So we've decided as a group that we're going to take all of our patients down,\u2019\u201d she told Fox News in an interview.\n\nLawrence\u2019s pain returned with a vengeance. He could barely move or sleep. He soiled his pants, unable to make the bathroom in time, Meredith said.\n\n\u201cIt feels like every nerve in my body is on fire,\u201d he told his wife.\n\nMeredith said she and her husband went to their primary care physician and asked for a referral to another pain clinic. They were told it would take a minimum of six weeks.\n\nThat was too much for Lawrence. In March, on the day of his next medical appointment, when his painkiller dosage was to be reduced again, he instead went to a nearby park with his wife. And on the very spot where they renewed their wedding vows just two years earlier, they held hands.\n\nHe raised a gun to his chest and killed himself.\n\nLawrence, who was 58, became one of an undetermined number among the nation\u2019s 20 million chronic pain sufferers who chose suicide after being cut back or denied prescriptions for opioids. The suicides have motivated many of those who continue to suffer from pain - and family members and advocates of those who took their lives \u2013 to call for a re-evaluation of the rush to reduce opioid dosages for those who most need them.\n\n\u201cWe have a terrible problem. We have people committing suicide for no other reason than being forced to stop opioids, pain medication, for chronic pain,\u201d said Thomas Kline, a North Carolina family doctor and former Harvard Medical School program administrator.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mass hysteria, a witch hunt. It\u2019s one of the worst health care crises in our history,\u201d said Kline, who has 26,000 Twitter followers, and a website where he publishes the names of those who he said committed suicide after having their opioids cut back or eliminated. \u201cThere are five to seven million people being tortured on purpose.\u201d\n\nThe CDC doesn\u2019t have numbers of those who commit suicide after having their pain medications cut. But most of the doctors who spoke to Fox News said they knew of between one and six patients who took their life after losing access to opioid treatment, and being turned away from other doctors who now see prescription painkillers as a hassle.\n\nSeveral prominent doctors and pain patient advocacy organizations said they have heard from hundreds who say they have been left in debilitating pain and are considering suicide. The issue earlier this year came to the attention of Human Rights Watch, which launched an investigation.\n\n\"Clearly, there are patients now who feel like life is not worth living if they return to living in pain,\" said Diederik Lohman, director of Health and Human Rights for Human Rights Watch. \"Many of the patients we spoke to are very law-abiding, and would turn to suicide before going to the street to get illicit drugs. The government has a duty to respond to the overdose crisis but to do so in a way that is harming people who have a legitimate medical issue is a human rights issue.\"\n\nWe have a terrible problem, we have people committing suicide for no other reason than being forced to stop opioids, pain medication, for chronic pain. It\u2019s mass hysteria, a witch hunt. It\u2019s one of the worst health care crises in our history. There are 5 to 7 million people being tortured on purpose. \u2014 Dr. Thomas Kline, former Harvard Medical School program administrator, and publisher of list of pain patients who have died by suicide.\n\nMany pain patients say they understand the urgent need of political leaders and government agencies to fight the drug overdose epidemic. But targeting the millions who legitimately suffer from chronic pain is grasping for a solution that doesn\u2019t address the preponderance of illegal drugs, they argue - or the rate of overdoses caused by them.\n\nThe CDC released a report Nov. 30 showing that despite a drop in painkiller prescriptions over the years, the drug overdose rate continues to soar, with the growth driven by the illicit opioid fentanyl and its cousins. It is a trend that has held for several years.\n\n\u201cPeople with pain shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because people without pain are abusing opioids,\u201d said Cynthia Toussaint, a former ballerina from California, who has Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), which left her bedridden for 10 years, and unable to speak for five. \u201cPain patients don\u2019t want to take opioids any more than cancer patients want to use chemotherapy. However, many people with pain need opioids to function physically and pursue the joyful aspects of life.\u201d\n\nAt a recent American Medical Association (AMA) meeting, the group\u2019s president, Dr. Barbara McAneny, spoke of how an advanced prostate cancer patient of hers attempted suicide after he was denied opioids by an insurer. \u201cThe pendulum swung too far when pain was designated a vital sign, and now we are in danger of it swinging back so far that patients are being harmed,\u201d she said, according to published reports.\n\nISSUES WITH CDC GUIDELINES\n\nFederal officials have said the CDC guidelines weren\u2019t intended to disrupt the proper prescribing and use of opioids. \u201cWe\u2019re not telling any doctor that they can\u2019t make a legitimate prescription,\u201d then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News, in an interview before he left office. \u201cMaybe some doctors are getting too cautious. We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSessions acknowledged \u201copioid prescribing can be essential for people,\u201d and said, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that people with serious pain problems are in need of real significant pain relief and sometimes [opioids] are the only thing that will provide relief, and it is absolutely legitimate to prescribe it.\u201d\n\nWe have heard about the suicides...It's tragic that anyone takes their life for any reason, including that they had their opioids unilaterally stopped. \u2014 Dr. Debbie Dowell, lead author of the 2016 \"CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain\"\n\nCDC officials added they are also aware chronic pain sufferers have committed suicide in their struggle to get by with fewer or no opioids.\n\n\u201cWe have heard about suicides,\u201d said Dr. Debbie Dowell, a senior CDC medical advisor, and lead author of the guidelines on opioid prescribing. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the reports. It\u2019s tragic that anyone takes their life for any reason, including that they had their opioids unilaterally stopped.\u201d\n\nDowell said the scope of suicides caused by under-treatment of chronic pain \u201cisn\u2019t something that\u2019s easy to measure. We\u2019ve looked at how we might measure this. Sometimes patients or their families don\u2019t report it.\u201d\n\nThe CDC guidelines focused on primary care physicians and recommended extreme caution in prescribing opioids. It also suggested a maximum daily dosage of 90 morphine milligram equivalents for first-time painkiller patients.\n\nBut the guidelines also warned against forcibly tapering or abruptly cutting off severe pain sufferers who have responsibly have taken opioids, noting that a drastic change could lead to withdrawal, and serious illness.\n\nUntreated pain, many health experts say, can also lead to hypertension, more serious pain conditions, and other problems. Health practitioners say this is a plight that could affect anyone -- all it takes is a slip, a fall, or a botched surgery that could bring on intense and perhaps long-term pain.\n\nDowell said patients should be prescribed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cWe believe everyone deserves effective pain management,\u201d she said. \u201cThe CDC guidelines are not a regulation or a law \u2013 it\u2019s guidance for providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never made a recommendation to take people off medication involuntarily, or to taper down involuntary,\" she said. \"It was meant to provide updated guidance about the benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain so that the provider and the patient \u2013 together \u2013 could make decisions.\u201d\n\nGUIDELINES BECOME ENFORCEMENT TOOLS\n\nThe CDC disclaimer was apparently lost among the headlines about the staggering number of deaths due to opioids. Political leaders and government officials often failed to note the bulk -- at least 60 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- of the overdose epidemic was caused by illicit drugs, not prescription painkillers.\n\nAnd when officials did address the portion of deaths due to prescriptions, advocates of safe opioid use argue, they often lumped together pain patients and people with addiction who illegally obtained someone else\u2019s prescribed opioids. That made for a perfect storm, which formed the basis for a slew of hardline state and federal policies, including a Trump administration vow to slash prescriptions by 30 percent over the next three years.\n\nEither in response to the CDC guidelines or as proactive measure to deal with the opioid crisis on their own, at least 33 states have enacted some type of legislation related to prescription limits, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. Health care providers and pain patients who have Medicare prescription plans are bracing for January, when the federal insurance program will give its insurers and pharmacists the authority to reject prescriptions that deviate from CDC recommended dosage.\n\n\u201cThe CDC guidelines were geared to primary care doctors, but they have been hijacked and weaponized as an excuse for draconian legislation,\u201d said Michael Schatman, a clinical psychologist and director of research and development at Boston Pain Care, a multi-disciplinary pain clinic, and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Pain Research. \u201cIllicit opioids, not prescription opioids, are driving overdose deaths.\u201d\n\nThe CDC guidelines...have been hijacked and weaponized as an excuse for draconian legislation. \u2014 Michael Schatman, editor-in-chief of the Journal of Pain\n\nThe disproportionate focus on prescription painkillers by officials responding to the overdose epidemic, pain specialists and public health researchers say, is in great part why the drug-related death rate continues to climb while legal opioids becomes less available to pain patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re targeting the most vulnerable and sickest people who have been on opioids a long time,\u201d said Dr. Stefan Kertesz, an addiction specialist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine. \u201cInsurers are issuing rules that say we won\u2019t cover long-term opioids for anyone over 90 milligrams. Well, five percent of people who receive opioids account for 60 percent of the milligrams prescribed. With so many milligrams going to a tiny group of very sick people, if you can knock a few people off these opioids you can show a big numeric reduction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing is dragging down the dose on the most disabled people,\u201d said Kertesz, who sits on several state opioid safety committees. \u201cPrescription control seems an easy answer to the epidemic, but that\u2019s not stopping addiction.\u201d\n\nCRIES FOR HELP, AND GIVING UP\n\nOn social media, comments sections on news sites, and in emails to Fox News, numerous pain sufferers say they have made suicide plans because their health care provider has forcibly reduced their dose to a deficient level, or cut them off entirely. They speak of being treated like drug abusers, submitting to frequent urine tests and pill counts.\n\n\"I have been on pain management since 2006,\" said a man from Tampa in a Facebook message. \"Have a crippling disease that there is no cure for, and can no longer get the medications I need. A few months ago I was researching death with dignity and other options for assisted suicide if I wasn\u2019t able to get the help needed down the road.\"\n\nSome posted comments about a loved one who died by suicide after losing access to a long-term treatment for pain, and finding it intolerable to continue suffering. Others said their spouse\u2019s suffering, together with the frustration and anguish of being turned away or undertreated by doctors, was the reason they came around to accepting their loved one\u2019s suicide plan.\n\nIn her new home in Georgia, its walls covered with pictures of her late husband, Meredith Lawrence recalled the helplessness she felt watching him suffer, as the pain worsened, and the drugs were tapered down.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018I have three choices,\u2019\u201d Meredith recalled. \u201cHe said \u2018I could do illegal drugs, I could suffer the rest of my life in pain, or I can end my life. I\u2019m not going to do the first two.\u2019\u201d\n\nLawrence\u2019s doctor did not respond to email and phone requests to comment for this story.\n\nMeanwhile, hashtags on Twitter like #SuicideDue2Pain, #DontPunishPain, #PatientsNotAddicts have become common.\n\nPeople with pain shouldn't have to suffer because people without pain are abusing opioids. \u2014 Cynthia Touissant, pain patient\n\n\u201cI think about suicide every day,\u201d said Dawn Anderson, a former trauma nurse from Indiana, whose doctor cut her opioid dosage after his office was raided by the DEA.\n\n\u201cI recently wrote a suicide note to my family,\u201d said Anderson, a diabetic whose legs were both amputated below the knee. \u201cThey have seen all I have gone through. I want to live. But not like this.\u201d\n\nAnderson, 53, now finds it too painful to stand on prosthetics because of what she says is undertreated pain, and is confined to a wheelchair.\n\n\u201cThe pain feels like an electrical shock that happens every 30 seconds in some parts of my body,\u201d she said, \u201cand in the back it\u2019s a stabbing pain, like a hot poker that is stuck and never coming out. The pain I endure on a daily basis is taking my will to live.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s doctor did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnne Fuqua, a former nurse in Alabama who herself suffers from chronic pain, has logged records of 167 suicides since 2014 that she maintained were directly a result of patients who had their opioids reduced or cut and suffered uncontrolled pain.\n\nFuqua said she is in the midst of verifying more suicides that have been reported to her.\n\nCaylee Cresta, a 26-year-old Massachusetts woman, has a rare disease, Stiff Person\u2019s Syndrome, that causes muscle spasms and rapid convulsions that fracture her bones and often leave her stuck in an unnatural position for days. She has had the condition since she was 19.\n\n\"You're in fear that your doctor will say that your next prescription is your last,\" Cresta said, adding that when she has \"a bad day\" it means \u201cI stop being a mother, a wife, a daughter.\u201d\n\nEnding the pain by ending it all has seemed, at times, like the way out.\n\nCALLING FOR TOUGHER ANTI-OPIOID POLICIES\n\nNot everyone agrees the problem is the cutting back of legal opioid prescriptions.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny, who directs opioid research at Brandeis University\u2019s Heller School for Social Policy and Management, believes government policies on opioids need to be even tougher.\n\nKolodny, who also is executive director of the Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and one of the nation\u2019s most vociferous critics of opioids, balks at the alarm sounding over the decreasing supply of prescription painkillers.\n\n\u201cThe effects of hydrocodone and oxycodone produced in the brain are indistinguishable from the effects produced by heroin,\u201d Kolodny said. \u201cSo my point is that when we talk about opioid pain medication, we\u2019re essentially talking about heroin pills.\u201d\n\nKolodny said opioids have an important role - in limited circumstances - such as ending suffering \u201cat the end of life for some patients,\u201d and \u201cfor a couple of days after major surgery.\u201d\n\nWhen we talk about opioid pain medication, we're essentially talking about heroin pills. \u2014 Dr. Andrew Kolodny, director of opioid research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management\n\nMany pain experts and patients blame Kolodny for pushing the federal agencies, particularly the CDC, to treat opioids as if it were heroin, and pain patients as people who are one opioid away from being addicts.\n\nKolodny said that isn't true.\n\n\u201cNo role - none - zilch,\u201d he said. \u201cPROP was one of many organizations that was asked by CDC to offer them feedback on the guideline. Our letter is publicly available. CDC did not make the changes we requested.\u201d\n\nTo Kolodny, \u201cIt\u2019s a manufactured controversy \u2026 They\u2019ll say with my opioid, I can at least get up from bed. For a heroin user it\u2019s the same thing for them. They say they feel horrible, can\u2019t do anything or function until they take their first dose of heroin in the morning.\u201d\n\nFEDS SAY THEY\u2019RE AT WAR\n\nSessions appeared to view the issue as a war that needs to be fought, full-speed ahead.\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest health hazard we\u2019ve had,\u201d he said of fatal overdoses.\u201cLet me just say this to the suicide problem and other problems: They\u2019re arising out of addiction to those drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know how powerful these addictions are. So people get into a situation where they can\u2019t keep taking the drugs, and some of them might conclude they can\u2019t live without them.\"\n\n\"We need to break that cycle,\" Sessions said. \"We\u2019re making progress at it, but we still prescribe far more pain pills than in any country in the world \u2026 we as a nation need to face up to that fact.\u201d\n\nFederal and state officials at the agencies at the forefront of the fight against opioids - including the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) \u2013 were hard-pressed to provide details to Fox News about just how many overdose deaths involved those legitimately prescribed opioids. A report by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, widely cited by many pain experts, said that among 477 people whose deaths were opioid\u2010related in 2018, 90 percent, or 423 of them, tested positive for fentanyl \u2013 a telltale sign of illegal opioid use.\n\nPain management experts said they share the concern and alarm over the terribly high percentage of drug overdoses.\n\n\u201cI share the nation\u2019s concern that more than 100 people a day die of an overdose.

Simply being in proximity with one of these insects is a stressful experience, to say nothing of the pain of receiving an actual sting. But now, thanks to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), you might have a newfound appreciation for the critters.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature Communications Biology, lead author Marcelo Der Torossian Torres and his colleagues explain that many small protein molecules found in wasp venom can kill species of bacteria that are pathogenic to humans. And, according to their experiments in vitro and in mice, modified versions of these peptides show exciting potential for development into new antibacterial agents. In case you\u2019ve been busy focusing on humanity\u2019s other ongoing crises, effective new antibiotics are sorely needed to prevent the antibiotic resistance apocalypse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve repurposed a toxic molecule into one that is a viable molecule to treat infections,\u201d author Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez said in a statement.\n\nThe group began their study by analyzing a dozen or so antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) found in the venom of the South American social wasp (Polybia paulista), which just so happens to also create anti-cancer chemicals. To find the AMP with the most promising broad-spectrum activity, each was tested against the classic bacterial species of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (both Gram-negative), and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive). The winner of these in vitro experiments was an alpha helix-structured molecule known as Pol-CP-NH2. Like most AMPs produced by insects and arachnids, Pol-CP-NH2 eliminates bacteria by interfering with their outer membrane.\n\nNext, the researchers started playing around with the chosen peptide\u2019s 12-amino acid structure to see if they could create a version that is both more effective against bacteria and harmless to human cells. The former was achieved by testing several dozen Pol-CP-NH2 variants against seven strains of bacteria and two of fungus. After modifying their candidate peptides using insights gained from these acitivty tests, the molecules were assessed for toxicity using a line of human embryonic kidney cells.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small enough peptide that you can try to mutate as many amino acid residues as possible to try to figure out how each building block is contributing to antimicrobial activity and toxicity,\u201d de la Fuente-Nunez said.", "keywords": ["toxicity", "vitro", "peptides", "key", "polcpnh2", "antibiotics", "wasp", "using", "try", "venom", "bacteria", "nextgeneration", "hold", "molecule"], "summary": "Wasp venom contains a potent mix of chemicals that can injure and even kill other animals when introduced through a nasty, hypodermic needle-like stinger.\nWriting in the journal Nature Communications Biology, lead author Marcelo Der Torossian Torres and his colleagues explain that many small protein molecules found in wasp venom can kill species of bacteria that are pathogenic to humans.\nIn case you\u2019ve been busy focusing on humanity\u2019s other ongoing crises, effective new antibiotics are sorely needed to prevent the antibiotic resistance apocalypse.\nLike most AMPs produced by insects and arachnids, Pol-CP-NH2 eliminates bacteria by interfering with their outer membrane.\nAfter modifying their candidate peptides using insights gained from these acitivty tests, the molecules were assessed for toxicity using a line of human embryonic kidney cells."}, {"link": "http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/free-naloxone-to-be-available-for-pennsylvania-residents,1478719/", "published": "2018-12-10T16:45:00", "title": "Free Naloxone to Be Available for Pennsylvania Residents -", "author": ["Geoff Rushton", "More Articles Geoff Rushton"], "text": "Naloxone will be distributed for free to any Pennsylvania resident on Thursday at nearly 80 locations across the commonwealth, including one in Centre County.\n\nOften known by the brand name Narcan, naloxone is a medication that can reverse overdoses by blocking the effects of opiates and opioids.\n\nLocally, it will be distributed by Centre LifeLink EMS between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday at the Centre County local assistance office, 2580 Park Center Boulevard, State College.\n\nThe free distribution is part of the state's ongoing effort to reduce opioid overdoses and help those who need treatment, according to a news release from Gov.

If cancerous DNA of any kind is present in the blood, the gold nanoparticles change color.\n\n\u201cDiscovering that cancerous DNA molecules formed entirely different 3D nanostructures from normal circulating DNA was a breakthrough that has enabled an entirely new approach to detect cancer non-invasively in any tissue type including blood,\u201d said Matt Trau, a professor at the University of Queensland and one of the study\u2019s co-authors, in a statement.\n\nAlso see: Kentucky congressman questions food stamps: \u2018If healthcare is a right, is food as well?\u2019\n\nThe researchers argued that their test could pave the way for a cheaper, faster cancer diagnosis process. The testing process only takes 10 minutes and can be adapted to occur within an inexpensive and portable diagnosis device, they said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019s the holy grail for all cancer diagnostics, but it looks really interesting as an incredibly simple universal marker of cancer, and as an accessible and inexpensive technology that doesn\u2019t require complicated lab-based equipment like DNA sequencing,\u201d Trau said.\n\nObservers though were most hesitant in celebrating the news. Indeed, this is just the latest example of a \u201csimple\u201d cancer blood test. Back in June, a separate group of researchers from the U.S. announced they had created a blood test that could identify as many as 10 types of cancer. And in January, scientists from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine announced the formulation of a $500 blood test called CancerSEEK, which could identify eight types of cancer before symptoms developed.\n\n\u201cI have often said that anytime you hear about a \u2018simple cancer test,\u2019 run for the hills because there\u2019s no such thing,\u201d Gary Schwitzer, founder and publisher of HealthNewsReview.org, wrote in an article advising caution regarding the latest cancer blood test. \u201cThis researcher may be referring to the technology, but the application of that technology \u2014 the leap from lab to bedside \u2014 brings with it many levels of complexity.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the Australian researchers noted that their test successfully identified 90% of cancer cases, but as Schwitzer noted \u201cthe claim of an incredibly simple universal marker starts to sound a bit hollow\u201d for those whose cancer wasn\u2019t identified by the test.\n\nMoreover, while the test allegedly can identify if someone has cancer to begin with, it cannot yet determine the origin or severity of the disease. For that, patients would need to go through additional testing, which takes time and can create anxiety.\n\nOthers expressed concern about whether the test could produce false positives, which could force people to go through unnecessary testing and stress.\n\nGet a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Neikirk's a physical therapist in Atlanta and knew that level was alarmingly high.\n\nShe left work and walked over to her obstetrician's office, which was in the same medical complex.\n\n\"They took my blood pressure again and they decided to admit me to the hospital,\" Neikirk, 29, says. \"So I was actually in the hospital for a night monitoring my blood pressure, monitoring the protein in my urine.\"\n\nThe doctors were making sure her blood pressure didn't get so high as to cause a stroke and that she didn't have symptoms of pre-eclampsia, a condition that can be fatal in pregnant women.\n\nWhen she was sent home the following day, the doctor put Neikirk on bed rest and told her to stop working. She wasn't offered any of the dozens of medications on the market that treat high blood pressure.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Burress/WABE Jim Burress/WABE\n\nThat's likely because none of those drugs is explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of pregnant women.\n\n\"Gestational hypertension itself is a separate condition, and we actually don't have any medications that are developed specifically for that,\" says Dr. Catherine Spong, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends women with pre-existing hypertension continue to use some blood pressure medications. And the group says women who develop high blood pressure can receive \"emergency treatment\" with some drugs.\n\nStill, bed rest isn't recommended. ACOG cautions against bed rest because there's no evidence that it helps pregnant women and it may even cause harm.\n\nNeikirk's doctor's office didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nNeikirk found herself in a situation that many pregnant women do today. They have a medical problem \u2014 either that existed before they were pregnant or was caused by being pregnant \u2014 and their doctors have to figure out how to deal with it without a strong foundation of medical research to help their decisions.\n\nHistorically, pregnant women have been excluded from medical research, because scientists and ethicists were concerned that experimenting on them could hurt them or their fetus.\n\n\"Pregnant women are considered a vulnerable population, so, in general, researchers aren't permitted to experiment on pregnant women,\" says Jacqueline Wolf, a professor of the history of medicine in the Department of Social Medicine at Ohio University.\n\nResearchers have to take special precautions to do studies on vulnerable populations, including children, the mentally disabled, incarcerated people and pregnant women. So researchers typically exclude these groups to get their studies approved.\n\nBut one result is that doctors caring for pregnant women have fewer tools to care for them when they're ill, Wolf says.\n\n\"That's where the irony comes in,\" she says. \"Because researchers are hardly ever permitted to conduct trials on pregnant women, we end up experimenting on pregnant women all the time, because we can't accumulate a solid fund of evidence. So we just stick with the old standards, or we introduce new things without doing trials on them.\"\n\nWhen a woman gets pregnant, her pre-existing medical conditions don't disappear, says UT Southwestern's Spong. She lists a litany of conditions \u2014 autoimmune disorders, diabetes, hypertension, infections, asthma, preterm labor, gestational hypertension or hyperemesis -- for which there are few therapies that are specifically developed for or tested on pregnant women.\n\n\"If someone comes into pregnancy on anti-hypertensive medicines, commonly they will continue on some type of anti-hypertensive medicine during pregnancy,\" Spong says. \"However, we don't have information about how that medicine should be dosed in pregnancy.\"\n\nShe says when women are pregnant, their blood volume doubles and their liver and kidney function change. No one knows how that affects the medication.\n\nSo doctors across the country find themselves prescribing medications, or taking patients off them, without strong evidence either way.\n\nBy keeping pregnant women out of studies, Spong says, \"You are putting them and their fetuses more at risk.\"\n\nSpong was chair of a federal task force, mandated in 2016 by the 21st Century Cures Act, that studied the gaps in health care knowledge about pregnant and lactating women. The group issued a 388-page report in September that recommends that pregnant women be routinely included in research studies, that the government devote time and money to studying existing drugs in pregnant women and that the government help develop new drugs to treat problems related to pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is supposed to respond to the task force recommendations by the end of December. He didn't respond to a request made through his spokeswomen for an interview.\n\nOver the years, scientists have accumulated observational research on the safety and efficacy of some existing drugs, including blood pressure medications, says Dr. Alison Cahill, chief of maternal fetal medicine at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAnd for those drugs that have shown themselves to be safe, she says, doctors usually recommend women continue to use them after they become pregnant.\n\nBut few studies compare a drug with a placebo in pregnant women, which is considered the gold standard, and few studies show how medications react differently after a woman becomes pregnant. Without that arsenal of well-researched medications, Cahill says she and her patients have to weigh the pros and cons of using a drug, or leaving an ailment untreated.\n\n\"I actually think that it's one of the most important responsibilities of a physician,\" she says. \"There's always things that we don't know. And I think part of respecting patients' autonomy, and their participation in medical decision-making, is to explain what we know but also to explain what we don't know even if that's hard.\"", "keywords": ["research", "studies", "pressure", "treatments", "doctors", "medical", "leave", "guessing", "medications", "women", "gaps", "medicine", "pregnant", "blood"], "summary": "ACOG cautions against bed rest because there's no evidence that it helps pregnant women and it may even cause harm.\nHistorically, pregnant women have been excluded from medical research, because scientists and ethicists were concerned that experimenting on them could hurt them or their fetus.\n\"Pregnant women are considered a vulnerable population, so, in general, researchers aren't permitted to experiment on pregnant women,\" says Jacqueline Wolf, a professor of the history of medicine in the Department of Social Medicine at Ohio University.\nBut one result is that doctors caring for pregnant women have fewer tools to care for them when they're ill, Wolf says.\n\"Because researchers are hardly ever permitted to conduct trials on pregnant women, we end up experimenting on pregnant women all the time, because we can't accumulate a solid fund of evidence."}, {"link": "https://www.1011now.com/content/news/Second-confirmed-case-of-AFM-reported-502374341.html", "published": "2018-12-10T19:21:56", "title": "Second confirmed case of AFM reported", "author": [], "text": "A second confirmed case of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a condition that causes muscle weakness, was reported to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

Credit: Noam Schneck/Columbia Engineering People who are grieving a major loss, such as the death of a spouse or a child, use different coping mechanisms to carry on with their lives. Psychologists have been able to track different approaches, which can reflect different clinical outcomes. One approach that is not usually successful is avoidant grief, a state in which people suffering from grief show marked, effortful, repeated, and often unsuccessful attempts to stop themselves from thinking about their loss. While researchers have shown that avoidant grievers consciously monitor their external environment in order to avoid reminders of their loss, no one has yet been able to show whether these grievers also monitor their mental state unconsciously, trying to block any thoughts of loss from rising to their conscious state.\n\nA new collaborative study between Columbia Engineering and Columbia University Irving Medical Center published online December 7 in SCAN: Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience demonstrates that avoidant grievers do unconsciously monitor and block the contents of their mind-wandering, a discovery that could lead to more effective psychiatric treatment for bereaved people. The researchers, who studied 29 bereaved subjects, are the first to show how this unconscious thought suppression occurs. They tracked ongoing processes of mental control as loss-related thoughts came in and out of conscious awareness during a 10-minute period of mind-wandering.\n\nCo-directed by Paul Sajda, professor of biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, and radiology, and John J. Mann, Paul Janssen Professor of Translational Neuroscience (in Psychiatry and in Radiology), the researchers used a new approach to track the interactions between mental processes: a machine-learning approach to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) called \"neural decoding,\" which establishes a neural pattern or fingerprint that can be used to determine when a given mental process is happening.\n\n\"The major challenge of our study was to be able 'look under the hood' of a person's natural mind-wandering state to see what underlying processes were actually controlling their experience,\" says Noam Schneck, lead author of the study, a postdoctoral fellow in Sajda's lab and now assistant professor of clinical medical psychology (in psychiatry) at Columbia University Department of Psychiatry/ New York State Psychiatric Institute. \"No one has done this kind of work before, showing this type of consistent control of one mental process\u2014thinking about loss\u2014by another\u2014selective attention\u2014as it happens spontaneously and unconsciously. These findings are significant because they open the door to building a fuller picture of the unconscious mind. We know that the experiences we have arise as a combination of constantly interacting networks. Now we have shown this interaction as it happens naturalistically as well as the way it controls experiences.\"\n\nThe brain networks respectively involved in controlling attention towards the deceased (red) and representing the deceased (blue). During a 10-minute period of mind-wandering, avoidant grievers engaged the control network to block representations activated in the representation network from reaching consciousness. Credit: Noam Schneck/Columbia Engineering\n\nThe team recorded fMRI from people who had lost a first-degree relative (a spouse or partner) within the last 14 months. The subjects performed a modified Stroop task, a test widely used in psychology to measure a person's ability to control the contents of attention, and a separate task presenting pictures and stories of the deceased. Using machine learning, the team then trained respective neural fingerprints for attentional control based on the Stroop task and mental representation of the deceased based on the pictures and stories. The team observed spontaneous fluctuations in these processes that occurred during a neutral mind-wandering fMRI task. They discovered that those with more avoidant grief engaged their attentional control process to block representations of the deceased from conscious awareness.\n\n\"Our findings show that avoidant grief involves attentional control to reduce the likelihood that deceased-related representations reach full conscious awareness,\" says Schneck. \"Even though they are not aware of it, avoidant grievers actively control their mental state so that spontaneous thoughts of loss do not enter their consciousness. This kind of tailoring of mind-wandering likely exhausts mental energy and leads to time periods when the thoughts actually do break through. It is like an ineffective pop-up blocker that runs in the background of your computer. You might not be aware that it's there but it slows down the overall operating speed and eventually breaks down and the pop ups get through.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest that one treatment goal for avoidant grievers may be to relax the conscious and unconscious mental controls that they maintain over their thinking of the loss. Since this control and monitoring happens outside of conscious awareness, this would be challenging to do, but training in mindfulness and acceptance may help some people relax both their conscious and unconscious mental controls.\n\n\"This research approach is an innovative collaboration between engineering and psychiatry that optimizes the tools of engineering to address critical questions in psychiatry,\" says Sajda, who is also a member of Columbia's Data Science Institute. \"What we've shown in this paper is that outside of our conscious awareness, we are constantly editing our own mental experiences to control what does and does not get in. And this process of editing is not always helpful.\"\n\nThe researchers are now planning a longitudinal study to see if avoidant grievers' internal vigilance might predict poor grief outcomes over the long term.\n\nThe study is titled \"Ongoing Monitoring of Mindwandering in Avoidant Grief Through Cortico-Basal-Ganglia Interactions.\"\n\nExplore further: Spontaneous thought and the mysteries of the wandering mind\n\nMore information: Noam Schneck et al, Ongoing Monitoring of Mindwandering in Avoidant Grief Through Cortico-Basal-Ganglia Interactions, Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (2018).

The alleged culprit: a fast-moving bacterial infection \u2014 linked to consuming raw or undercooked shellfish \u2014 that caused her organs to shut down.\n\nThe place where Kelsch ate oysters has not been publicly released.\n\nOysters have long been a trademark of southern cuisine, but they also pose health risks for some.\n\n\"There's always going to be a small amount of risk,\" says Dr. Fred Lopez, who studies infectious disease at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center.\n\nLopez says the biggest danger comes from a pervasive bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus, which is what reportedly killed Kelsch.\n\nVibrio vulnificus naturally thrives in brackish waters where the temperature is above 68 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, it's actually more common in the Gulf of Mexico, where the waters are warmer, than on the East and West coasts.\n\n\"If you're consuming a raw oyster that comes from the Gulf Coast waters ... particularly in the summer months,\" says Lopez, \"You have to assume that it has Vibrio vulnificus.\"\n\nThomas \"Uptown T\" Stewart is the famous oyster shucker at the New Orleans restaurant Pascal's Manale. Stewart has worked at the restaurant for more than 30 years, and he knows his clients well. It seems like he's always shouting \"What's happening, y'all?\" to people walking through the front door.\n\nStewart's side of the bar is covered by a pile of raw oysters and ice. One by one he digs them out, pries open the shells with a knife and frees the meat with effortless speed.\n\nBrent and Paula Coussou are on the other side of the bar. They're each nursing a beer, and there's a row of empty oysters between them. They say they've been coming to the restaurant for as long as Stewart has been working there.\n\n\"This guy here's the best. The best,\" says Brent Coussou.\" I mean, I've been to a lot of places and it's just, his oysters are very clean. He doesn't have any chiplies in his oysters.\"\n\nThat may not be an official term, but he's referring to those crunchy bits of shell that sometimes get slurped down with the raw oyster.\n\nCoussou heard the news about the politician who died, but he's not worried. He says he's never gotten sick.\n\nAlthough many oysters are exposed to Vibrio vulnificus, they aren't dangerous to everyone. People with specific pre-existing health problems are most vulnerable.\n\nThat list includes liver disease, diabetes, kidney disease, alcoholism and cancer. Generally speaking, people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk. Lopez says those people shouldn't eat raw oysters \u2014 period.\n\n\"They can eat shellfish,\" he says. \"They just need to make sure that they're thoroughly cooked \u2014 boiled, fried, steamed, etc.\"\n\nProper cooking kills the bacteria completely. All things considered, Vibrio vulnificus infections are still very rare.\n\nBut when people with weakened immune systems are infected by Vibrio vulnificus, anywhere from one-third to one-half of those people die.\n\n\"That's a very high mortality rate,\" says Lopez.\n\nThat's why there are very strict regulations around oyster harvesting. The Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC) sets those regulations for the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"Probably, shellfish and milk are the two most regulated foods in the country,\" says Ken Moore, Executive Director of the ISSC.\n\nThere's an old adage, that you should only eat raw oysters in months with an \"R.\" September through April \u2014 basically the cooler months. So this isn't a new idea.\n\nMoore says regulations have tightened over the last 10 years or so. For example, during the warm summer months, oysters that are meant to be eaten raw must be refrigerated within an hour of harvesting. He says it's had a positive effect.\n\n\"We've actually seen a reduction in [raw oyster Vibrio vulnificus] cases,\" Moore says. \"We think that the controls that we have in place are actually keeping those numbers low.\"\n\nDr. Alex Billioux agrees. He's the assistant secretary for Louisiana's Office of Public Health.\n\n\"It is very, very rare to become ill from eating oysters,\" says Billioux.\n\nAnd though infections from raw oysters are down, Billioux says the amount of Vibrio vulnificus in the water is actually increasing due to warming waters.\n\n\"I definitely expect our jobs to become harder as the waters continue to warm because of climate change,\" he says.\n\nThat could mean more testing, scrutiny, and risk in the future.\n\n\"I think that's sort of the big point when we start talking about the climate change effects,\" Billioux says. \"It really can touch everything.\"\n\nThis story comes to us from member station WWNO in New Orleans.

In fact, people in their 70s who have been exercising regularly for decades seem to have put a brake on the aging process, maintaining the heart, lung and muscle fitness of healthy people at least 30 years younger.\n\nTake 74-year-old Susan Magrath, a retired nurse practitioner who lives in Muncie, Ind. Magrath has been running almost daily for 45 years. She often runs outdoors and describes it as addictive. \"It's just such a release, just a wonderful release,\" she says. \"I ran today and there were little snowflakes coming down, and I was down by the river and it's just wonderful. And I think it's become more of a contemplative meditative process for me.\"\n\nMagrath may be living proof that lifelong exercise helps with cardiovascular and muscle health. She recently took part in a study at the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, also in Muncie, headed by exercise physiologist Scott Trappe. Trappe is among the first to study the enticing new population of lifelong exercisers.\n\nAfter the running and aerobic boom of the 1970s, large numbers of septuagenarians stuck with it and have been exercising regularly for the past 50 years. In this population, Trappe says, \"We were interested in basically two questions: One, what was their cardiovascular health? And two, what was their skeletal muscle health?\"\n\nWhat he saw surprised him. \"We saw that people who exercise regularly year after year have better overall health than their sedentary counterparts. These 75-year-olds \u2014 men and women \u2014 have similar cardiovascular health to a 40- to 45-year-old.\"\n\n\" 'Exercise wins' is the take-home message,\" he says.\n\nIn the study, Trappe divided 70 healthy participants into three groups. Those in the lifelong exercise group were on average 75 years old and primarily kept their heart rates up through running and cycling. They had a history of participating in structured exercise four to six days a week for a total of about seven hours a week.\n\nThe second group included individuals who were also, on average, 75 years old but did not engage in structured exercise regimens, although they might have participated in occasional leisure walking or golf.\n\nThe third group consisted of young exercisers who were, on average, 25 years old and worked out with the same frequency and length of time as the lifelong exercisers.\n\nAll participants were assessed in the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University. Cardiovascular health was gauged by having participants cycle on an indoor bike to determine VO2 max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake, which is the measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can use during intense exercise and is an indicator of aerobic endurance. During the cycling test, which became increasingly challenging, individuals exhaled into a mouthpiece that measured oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\n\nThe aerobic profile of the participants' muscles was measured by taking a sample via a biopsy about the size of a pea, says Trappe. Then in the lab, researchers examined the micro vessels, or capillaries, that allow blood to flow through the muscle itself.\n\nThey also looked at specific enzymes that provide fuel to the working muscle and help break down carbohydrates and fats.\n\nAlthough the study was relatively small, the findings, which were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology in August, suggest a dramatic benefit of lifelong exercise for both muscle health and the cardiovascular system.\n\n\"Lifelong exercisers had a cardiovascular system that looked 30 years younger,\" says Trappe. This is noteworthy because, for the average adult, the ability to process oxygen declines by about 10 percent per decade after age 30.\n\n\"It's kind of a slow decay over time that's probably not so noticeable in your 30s or 40s,\" says Trappe, but eventually as years go on, becomes apparent. People can get out of breath more easily and may have difficulty pushing themselves physically.\n\nThe age-related reduction in VO2 max is directly associated with an increasing risk of multiple chronic diseases, mortality and loss of independence. Maintaining a strong heart and lung system has been shown to decrease these health risks.\n\nAs for muscle health, the findings were even more significant, says Trappe. Trappe says researchers were surprised to find the 75-year-old muscles of lifelong exercisers were about the same as the muscles of the 25-year-olds. \"If I showed you the muscle data that we have, you wouldn't know it was from an older individual. You would think it's from somebody that's a young exerciser,\" he says.\n\nDavid Costill, 82, was not part of the study but is a former colleague of Trappe's and professor emeritus of exercise science at Ball State University. As an exercise physiologist, he has always known about the benefits of exercise and has been committed since high school.\n\nHe says he has spent about \"60 years actively exercising.\" Costill ran marathons for about 20 years until his knees started to bother him, so he headed to the pool. \"And I've been swimming for the last 35 years.\"\n\nWhen Costill looks at his friends, he says he finds he can do a lot more physically than they can. \"If I'm out with a group of my peers, guys who are near 80, and we're going someplace, it seems to me they're all walking at half speed.\"\n\nTrappe says the findings are clear: 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day may be the key to a healthy life. But you don't have to run marathons or compete in cycling events. \"If you want to do 30 to 45 minutes of walking a day, the amount of health benefit you are going to get is going to be significant and substantial,\" he says. \"Will it equal the person training for competitive performances? No. But it will outdo the couch potato.\"\n\nUnfortunately, couch potatoes are the norm. Federal guidelines recommend two hours and 30 minutes of moderate exercise a week, or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Yet 77 percent of Americans do not come close to getting that amount of exercise.\n\nDr. Clyde Yancy, spokesperson for the American Heart Association and chief of cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says the findings suggest \"a lifelong investment in health and fitness appears to be associated with a really sustainable benefit out until the outer limits of life.\"\n\nSince we are living longer, maintaining a good quality of life is more important than ever. While the study was small and the findings need to be confirmed, they present a \"strong argument\" for lifelong exercise that is inexpensive and accessible for everyone. \"If you can swim, do yoga, cycle, or walk,\" you can benefit,\" Yancy says.", "keywords": ["lifelong", "university", "hearts", "look", "trappe", "muscle", "cardiovascular", "fit", "wins", "30", "exercise", "health", "study", "findings", "younger", "seniors"], "summary": "Exercise Wins: Fit Seniors Can Have Hearts That Look 30 Years YoungerEnlarge this image toggle caption David Trood/Getty Images David Trood/Getty ImagesWe know we need to exercise for our health, but a lifelong exercise habit may also help us feel younger and stay stronger well into our senior years.\nMagrath may be living proof that lifelong exercise helps with cardiovascular and muscle health.\nIn this population, Trappe says, \"We were interested in basically two questions: One, what was their cardiovascular health?\nThese 75-year-olds \u2014 men and women \u2014 have similar cardiovascular health to a 40- to 45-year-old.\"\nThose in the lifelong exercise group were on average 75 years old and primarily kept their heart rates up through running and cycling."}, {"link": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/just-thinking-you-have-poor-endurance-genes-changes-your-body", "published": "2018-12-10T20:05:16", "title": "Just thinking you have poor endurance genes changes your body", "author": ["Jocelyn Kaiser"], "text": "Just thinking you have poor endurance genes changes your body\n\nIf you want to win a race or stick to a difficult diet, coaches of all kinds will tell you it\u2019s all about \u201cmind over matter.\u201d But that advice rarely crosses over into the medical community, where an inborn ability\u2014or risk\u2014is thought to depend more on genes and environment than on mindset. Now, in a study examining what may be a novel form of the placebo response, psychologists have found that just telling a person they have a high or low genetic risk for certain physical traits can influence how their body functions when exercising or eating, regardless of what genetic variant they actually have.\n\nThe results could be an eye-opener for medical providers and consumer DNA testing companies. \u201cFrom a psychological science perspective, it\u2019s not terribly surprising that genetic risk information can function this way,\u201d says behavioral researcher Susan Persky of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved in the study. But it\u2019s a novel idea in the genetics community, she adds.\n\nAfter getting ethics approval to conduct an experiment that involved deceiving participants, graduate student Bradley Turnwald and co-workers in the lab of psychologist Alia Crum at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, recruited 116 young and middle-aged people for what they called a \u201cpersonalized medicine study.\u201d They tested each for a gene variant that influences a person\u2019s capacity for exercise. The volunteers also took a treadmill test.\n\nA week later, the participants were given a result, based not on their actual data, but rather on one of two groups into which they had been randomly placed. Some were told they had the form of a gene called CREB1 that makes a person tire easily; others were told they had the high-endurance version. Then they ran on the treadmill again.\n\nThis time, those who had been told they had the low-endurance version of CREB1 did worse on the test, even if they had the other variant. Compared with their results on the first test, on average their bodies removed toxic carbon dioxide less efficiently and their lung capacity dropped, the team reports today in Nature Human Behavior. And those who thought they had the high-endurance form of the CREB1 gene ran slightly longer on average before feeling hot and tired, regardless of what gene variant they had. \u201cSimply giving people this information changed their physiology,\u201d Turnwald says.\n\nThe team also tested a second group of 107 people for its version of FTO, a gene that influences how full we feel after eating. Some versions can also predispose people to obesity. Participants ate a small meal and rated their fullness. After being told, at random, that they had a version of FTO that made them hungrier than average or one that made them easily sated, participants ate the same meal. Those told they had the \u201chungry\u201d version of the gene didn\u2019t feel any different. But those who were told they had the other version felt less hungry on average after eating; they also had higher blood levels of a hormone that indicates a feeling of fullness.\n\nIn the cases of both genes, some of the changes in bodily reactions were larger than what the researchers measured between people who actually carried different versions of the genes, suggesting their attitude could change their risk as much or more than their genetics. \u201cWhat people haven\u2019t fully appreciated is that that information also puts you into a mindset: \u2018I\u2019m at high risk or I'm protected,\u2019\u201d Crum says. \u201cAnd that alone can have potent effects on physiology and motivation.\u201d\n\nSuch a placebo response to genetic information could have serious implications for genetic testing, especially commercially available products that can reveal risk scores for conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer.

The federal government, through the National Institutes of Health, has launched the most ambitious study of adolescent brain development ever attempted. In part, scientists are trying to understand what no one currently does: how all that screen time impacts the physical structure of your kids' brains, as well as their emotional development and mental health.\n\nAt 21 sites across the country scientists have begun interviewing nine and ten-year-olds and scanning their brains. They'll follow more than 11,000 kids for a decade, and spend $300 million doing it. Dr. Gaya Dowling of the National Institutes of Health gave us a glimpse of what they've learned so far.\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: The focus when we first started talking about doing this study was tobacco, marijuana, all drugs the screen time component really came into play because we were wondering what is the impact? I mean, clearly kids spend so much time on screens.\n\nThe first wave of data from brain scans of 4,500 participants is in and it has Dr. Dowling of the NIH and other scientists intrigued.\n\nThe MRI's found significant differences in the brains of some kids who use smartphones, tablets, and video games more than seven hours a day.\n\n\"We're sort of in the midst of a natural kind of uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children.\"\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: What we can say is that this is what the brains look like of kids who spend a lot of time on screens. And it's not just one pattern.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That's fascinating.\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: It's very fascinating.\n\nThe colors show differences in the nine and ten-year-olds' brains. The red color represents premature thinning of the cortex. That's the wrinkly outermost layer of the brain that processes information from the five senses.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What is a thinning of the cortex mean?\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: That's typically thought to be a maturational process. So what we would expect to see later is happening a little bit earlier.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Should parents be concerned by that?\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: We don't know if it's being caused by the screen time. We don't know yet if it's a bad thing. It won't be until we follow them over time that we will see if there are outcomes that are associated with the differences that we're seeing in this single snapshot.\n\nThe interviews and data from the NIH study have already revealed something else: kids who spend more than two hours a day on screens got lower scores on thinking and language tests.\n\nAnderson Cooper: When the study is complete, is it possible that a researcher will be able to say whether or not screen time is actually addictive?\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: We hope so. We'll be able to see not only how much time are they spending, how they perceive it impacting them, but also what are some of the outcomes. And that will get at the question of whether there's addiction or not.\n\nAnderson Cooper: When will you have the answers that you're searching for?\n\nDr. Gaya Dowling: Some questions we'll be able to answer in a few years. But some of the really interesting questions about these long-term outcomes, we're gonna have to wait awhile because they need to happen.\n\nThat delay leaves researchers who study technology's impact on very small children anxious.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: In many ways, the concern that investigators like I have is that we're sort of in the midst of a natural kind of uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis at Seattle Children's Hospital was the lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' most recent guidelines for screen time. They now recommend parents, \"avoid digital media use, except video chatting, in children younger than 18 to 24 months.\"\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: So what we do know about babies playing with iPads is that they don't transfer what they learn from the iPad to the real world, which is to say that if you give a child an app where they play with virtual Legos, virtual blocks, and stack them, and then put real blocks in front of them, they start all over.\n\nAnderson Cooper: If they try to do it in real life, it's as if they've never done it before.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: Exactly. It's not a transferable skill. They don't transfer the knowledge from two dimensions to three.\n\nDr. Christakis is one of the few scientists who have already done experiments on the influence screens have on children under the age of two. It's a critical period for human brain development.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: If you're concerned about your teenager being addicted to their iphone, your infant is much more vulnerable and using the exact same device.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Your infant is more vulnerable because why?\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: Because the experience of making something happen is so much more gratifying to them.\n\nIn a small pilot study that Dr. Christakis conducted on 15 children, researchers gave toddlers three toys: first a plastic guitar, then an iPad that played musical notes and finally an iPad with an app that rewarded the kids with lights, colors and sounds.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: So at a very specific time, the research assistant will ask the child to give what they're playing with back.\n\nAnderson Cooper: To give it to the research assistant.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: To give it to the research assistant.\n\nSixty-six percent of the time with a traditional toy, the child will do just that.\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: With the iPad that simulates that, they give it back almost with the same frequency. But with the iPad app that when they push on it, it does all kinds of things, they're much less likely to give it back.\n\nWith the more interactive iPad app, the percentage of kids willing to hand it back to the researcher dropped from 60 percent to 45 percent.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It's that much more engaging?\n\nDr. Dimitri Christakis: It's that much more engaging. And that's what we find in the laboratory.\n\nIt's engaging by design, as Tristan Harris told us in a story we reported more than a year ago.\n\nTristan Harris: There's a whole playbook of techniques that get used to get you using the product for as long as possible.\n\nHarris is a former Google manager who was one of the first Silicon Valley insiders to publicly acknowledge that phones and apps are being designed to capture and keep kids' attention.\n\nTristan Harris: This is about the war for attention and where that's taking society and where that's taking technology.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You know it's one thing for adults, for kids this is a whole other thing?\n\nTristan Harris: That is where this gets particularly sensitive\u2026is developmentally do we want this war for attention to be affecting our children?\n\nAnderson Cooper: Do you think parents understand the complexities of what their kids are dealing with?\n\nTristan Harris: No. And I think this is really important. Because there's a narrative that, oh, I guess they`re just doing this like we used to gossip on the phone, but what this misses is that your telephone in the 1970s didn't have a thousand engineers on the other side of the telephone who were redesigning it to work with other telephones and then updating the way your telephone worked every day to be more and more persuasive.\n\nUntil recently, it was impossible to see what happens inside a young brain when a person is focused on a mobile device. But now scientists at the University of California, San Diego have hacked that problem.\n\nDr. Kara Bagot is an investigator on that $300 million NIH study. Her team is scanning teenager's brains as they follow Instagram, the most popular social media app. When we met 18-year-old Roxy Shimp, she was about to participate in Dr. Bagot's study.\n\nAnderson Cooper: How much time do you actually spend on screens?\n\nRoxy Shimp: I check my phone pretty regularly I'd say.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What's pretty regularly?\n\nRoxy Shimp: Every at least 10 to 20 minutes.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Is that a conservative estimate?\n\nRoxy Shimp: Probably.\n\nShe can't take her phone into the MRI because of the powerful magnets in the machine, so a mirror has been placed above her face to allow her to look across the room at a movie screen displaying images from her Instagram account. This way, Dr. Bagot can see exactly which parts of the brain's reward system are most active while using social media.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So you can actually see a part of the brain light up when you're feeling good.\n\nDr. Kara Bagot: Yes, in the scanner.\n\nAnderson Cooper: In the scanner.\n\nBased on her data and the results from other studies, Dr. Bagot is among scientists who believe screen time stimulates the release of the brain chemical dopamine, which has a pivotal role in cravings and desire.\n\nDr. Kara Bagot: So you're more likely to act impulsively and use social media compulsively instead of, like, checking yourself.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You want to keep on it to keep getting--\n\nDr. Kara Bagot: The good feelings.\n\nTeenagers now spend on average four and a half hours a day on their phones. All that time has resulted in a fundamental shift in how a generation of american kids acts and thinks.\n\nJean Twenge: When smartphones went from being something only a few people had to something that the majority of people had, it had this really big effect on how teens related to each other.\n\n\"it should be a tool that you use. Not a tool that uses you.\"\n\nJean Twenge is a psychology professor at San Diego State University. She spent five years combing through four large, national surveys of 11 million young people since the 1960's. She discovered sudden changes in the behavior and mental health of teens born in 1995 and later, a generation that she calls \"I-gen\".\n\nJean Twenge: They're the first generation to spend their entire adolescence with smartphones so a lot of them can't remember a time before smartphones existed.\n\nAnderson Cooper: There have been generational shifts before in the past, haven't there?\n\nJean Twenge: Certainly. But this one's much more sudden and pronounced than most of the others.\n\nThe iPhone was introduced in 2007. Smartphones gained widespread usage among young people by 2012. Jean Twenge says she was startled to find that in the four years that followed, the percentage of teens who reported drinking or having sex fell. But the percentage who said they were lonely or depressed spiked. It's possible other factors may have played a role, but Twenge says she wasn't able to identify any that correlated as closely as the growing popularity of the smartphone and social media.\n\nJean Twenge: It's not just the loneliness and depression from these surveys. It's also that ER visits for self harm like cutting have tripled among girls age 10 to 14.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What are teens doing on their phones that could be connected to depression?\n\nJean Twenge: It could be anything. There's kind of two different schools of thought on this. That it's the specific things that teens are doing on their phones that's the problem. Or it could be just the sheer amount of time that they're spending on their phones that is the problem.\n\nFinding definitive answers about social media's influence on mental health can be a frustrating exercise. Eighty-one percent of teens in a new national survey by the Pew Research Center said they feel more connected to their friends and associated social media use with feeling included. But in a month-long experiment at the University of Pennsylvania, college students who limited themselves to just 30 minutes a day on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat reported significant decreases in loneliness and depression.\n\nJean Twenge: A lot of times with these technological shifts is these things are adopted because they're so wonderful and convenient. And we don't realize until later the possible consequences. And I think fortunately in the last year or so there's been more discussion about how can we manage the use of our devices.\n\nFacebook and Instagram have introduced settings to allow users to monitor app use. And Apple, the company that started the smartphone revolution, has built a new feature for parents to set time restrictions on apps.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Tech companies say there are tools out there that they have supplied and that they're doing their part.\n\nJean Twenge: A lot of parents, probably the majority I talk to, don't even realize those tools are available. and I wish they happened five years ago instead of now. But better late than never.\n\nFor its part, the National Institutes of Health has just finished enrolling the 11,000 kids for its landmark brain study. Early next year, the data will be made available to any researcher around the world investigating the effect of a device that's become the most dominant technological presence in young lives.\n\nJean Twenge: Smartphones are great things, They are a wonderful piece of technology. They allow us to find our way around and look up the weather and do all that kind of stuff. And if you do it for a half an hour or an hour a day, fine. No problem. Then you're using it for what it's good for. But you have to use it for what it's good for and then put it down. I mean, it should be a tool that you use. Not a tool that uses you.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast.

A team of scientists at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a test with CRISPR and other gene-editing tools that they believe can be used to screen for potentially harmful variations of TNNT2.\n\nThey developed the test with the help of one family affected by severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, they explained in a statement. Last year, a 65-year-old woman was treated at the Penn Center for Inherited Cardiac Disease. Her gene sequence revealed the presence of abnormal TNNT2, but it wasn\u2019t clear if the variant was causing her disease. Nor did her physicians know if her two children and six grandchildren were at high risk.\n\nSo they used gene editing to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) containing the woman\u2019s TNNT2 variant. They then prompted the iPSCs to turn into mature heart muscle cells and exposed them to an adrenaline-like chemical to induce faster beating. Had the beats been irregular, that would have been a sign that the gene variant was pathogenic, because severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes irregular heartbeats. But the cells responded normally\u2014a sign that the patient\u2019s TTNT2 variant was benign.\n\nFREE DAILY NEWSLETTER Like this story? Subscribe to FierceBiotech!

They used a combination of CRISPR and other editing tools to create a platform that allows for the rapid insertion of gene variants into iPSCs.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Source: CNBC.com By Christina Farr, CNBC\n\nMorgan Gleason has had a lot more experience with the health-care system than most college students. Nine years ago, she was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called Juvenile Dermatomyositis, which causes symptoms like weak muscles and skin rashes.\n\nLike many patients with a chronic illness, Gleason sees a lot of doctors. So she and her mother, Amy, who works at a health IT company called CareSync, always make it a point to request her medical records after a visit so they can store a copy of all her records in one place.\n\nThe 20-year-old patient advocate Morgan Gleason. Courtesy Morgan Gleason\n\nTwo years ago, Gleason requested her records after visiting a women\u2019s health clinic in Florida. To her surprise, she found a note in the record saying she\u2019d had two children. One was apparently still living and the other had died shortly after she gave birth.\n\nAccording to the chart, which she provided to CNBC, Gleason would had to have given birth to the first child at age 13 for the dates to line up.\n\nIn fact, Gleason had never been pregnant.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first mistake. In a different record, Gleason had spotted a diagnosis of diabetes shouldn\u2019t have been there. She had looked into it after a doctor had gone off script by peppering her with questions about her blood sugar.\n\nGleason\u2019s case might seem extreme, but it is far from unusual.\n\nRoss Koppel, a leading academic in the world of health IT, estimates that about 70 percent of records have wrong information.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of records out there and screw-ups happen,\u201d he said.\n\nMost errors are irrelevant to health outcomes \u2014 for instance, a record might state that a patient hurt her finger on Thursday, when it was in fact, Friday.\n\nBut mistakes can be harmful or even fatal if they lead to a misdiagnosis, a failure to recognize an allergy or a wrong dose of a medication. A Johns Hopkins study found that more than 250,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical mistakes, making it the third-leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Other studies have found the numbers to be higher than 400,000.\n\nAfter she discovered the mistake, Gleason called the doctor\u2019s office and informed them that she did not have any children.\n\nBut instead of fixing it, the assistant on the other end of the line insisted that Gleason was wrong. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t told us this, there\u2019s no way this could have been in your chart,\u201d Gleason was told. She ended up having to file a formal document requesting a correction of her record, before any changes were made.\n\nKoppel, a sociologist and bio-informaticist at the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medical School, was not surprised that Gleason had such a hard time getting the correction. Doctors don\u2019t like to admit wrongdoing for fear of being sued, he explained, but there\u2019s also an institutionalized distrust of patients. Some patients do lie or hide certain embarrassing facts.\n\nThat needs to change, suggests Koppel, because doctors are human. It\u2019s easy to imagine how mistakes might happen if a busy resident has multiple records open on a laptop, and they\u2019re using copy and paste. In other instances, they might simply mistype or mishear something: A common example of that is \u201chypo\u201d versus \u201chyper.\u201d\n\nThere are also cases of mistaken identity. In the United States, unlike in other developed nations, such as the United Kingdom and many of the Nordic countries, there\u2019s no unique patient identifier number linked to a single centralized record. That makes it a challenge for doctors to ensure that they\u2019ve pulled up the record of the right patient if they happen to have a common name.\n\nTo rectify that, Koppel always encourages nurses and doctors to take photos of their patients and clip them to the record so they can at least ensure that they\u2019re talking to the right person.\n\nGleason is extremely concerned that these errors will continue to follow her, given the broad array of medical record vendors. It\u2019s already been hours of work for her to try to fix them across multiple systems.\n\nFor that reason, she has a few words of caution for new technology players like Amazon and Apple as they get deeper into health care with a particular focus on medical records.\n\n\u201cI hope that companies in tech don\u2019t start looking at the text in physician notes and making determinations without a human or someone who knows my medical history very well,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about more errors.\u201d", "keywords": ["theres", "fix", "patient", "medical", "doctors", "records", "record", "gleason", "health", "hard", "electronic", "wrong", "mistakes", "patients"], "summary": "Courtesy Morgan GleasonTwo years ago, Gleason requested her records after visiting a women\u2019s health clinic in Florida.\nIn a different record, Gleason had spotted a diagnosis of diabetes shouldn\u2019t have been there.\nRoss Koppel, a leading academic in the world of health IT, estimates that about 70 percent of records have wrong information.\nGleason is extremely concerned that these errors will continue to follow her, given the broad array of medical record vendors.\nFor that reason, she has a few words of caution for new technology players like Amazon and Apple as they get deeper into health care with a particular focus on medical records."}, {"link": "https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/valley-woman-talks-life-without-stomach-after-cancer", "published": "2018-12-10T15:10:00", "title": "Valley woman talks life without stomach after cancer", "author": ["Allison Rodriguez"], "text": "PHOENIX - It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season.

Although definitive data aren't available, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology estimates that nearly 1 in 10 people who access records online end up requesting that they be corrected for a variety of reasons.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, an incorrect diagnosis, scan or lab result may have been inserted into a record, raising the possibility of inappropriate medical evaluation or treatment. This, too, is something that Tidyman's father encountered soon after moving from Massachusetts to Washington. (Her parents have since passed away.)\n\nWhen both his new primary care physician and cardiologist asked about kidney cancer -- a condition he didn't have -- Tidyman reviewed materials from her father's emergency room visit. There, she saw that \"renal cell carcinoma\" (kidney cancer) was listed instead of \"basal cell carcinoma\" (skin cancer) -- an illness her father had mentioned while describing his medical history.\n\n\"It was a transcription error; something we clearly had to fix,\" Tidyman said.\n\nOmissions from medical records -- allergies that aren't noted, lab results that aren't recorded, medications that aren't listed -- can be equally devastating.\n\nSusan Sheridan discovered this nearly 20 years ago after her husband, Pat, had surgery to remove a mass in his neck. A hospital pathology report identified synovial cell sarcoma, a type of cancer, but somehow the report didn't reach his neurosurgeon. Instead, the surgeon reassured the couple that the tumor was benign.\n\nSix months later, when Pat returned to the hospital in distress, this error of omission was discovered. By then, Pat's untreated cancer had metastasized to his spinal canal. He died 2\u00bd years later.\n\n\"I tell people, 'Collect all your medical records, no matter what' so you can ask all kinds of questions and be on the alert for errors,\" said Sheridan, director of patient engagement with the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine.\n\nIn less dire scenarios, a patient's name, address, phone number or personal contacts may be incorrect, making it difficult to reach someone in the event of an emergency or causing a bill to be sent to the wrong location. Or, your family history may not be conveyed accurately. Or, you may not have received a service recorded in your record -- for instance, a stress test -- and want to contest the bill.\n\nDave deBronkart, a 68-year-old cancer survivor and patient activist, recounts mistakes he and his family have experienced. Once, he checked a radiology report through a Boston hospital's patient portal. It had his name on it but identified him as a 53-year-old woman.\n\nIn another instance, the records that accompanied deBronkart's mother to a rehabilitation center after a hip replacement incorrectly identified her as having an underactive thyroid when in fact she had an overactive thyroid. DeBronkart's sisters, who asked to look at their mother's chart, discovered the mistake and had it fixed on the spot, so she wouldn't get potentially harmful medications.\n\n\"It's important for people to realize how easy it is for mistakes to get into the system and for nobody to know it. And that can cause downstream harm,\" deBronkart said.\n\nThe law that guarantees your right to review your medical record, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 , offers some recourse: If you think you've discovered an error in your medical record, you have the right to ask for a correction. (For more information about how to obtain your record, see my earlier column here .)\n\nStart by asking your doctor or hospital if they have a form (either a paper or electronic version) you should use to submit a suggested change.\n\nA simple error such as a wrong phone number can be corrected by drawing a thin line through the material and writing a suggested change in the margins or making an electronic note. A more complicated error such as incorrect description of your symptoms or a diagnosis that you're contesting may require a brief statement from you explaining what material in the record is wrong, why and how it should be altered.\n\nPhysicians and hospitals are required to respond in writing within 60 days, with the possibility of a 30-day extension. (Some states set shorter deadlines.) But medical providers are not obligated to accept your request. If you receive a rejection, you have the right to add another statement contesting this decision to your medical record. You can also file a complaint with the government office that oversees HIPAA or a state agency that licenses physicians.\n\nDevin O'Brien, senior counsel with The Doctors Company, the largest physician-owned medical malpractice firm in the U.S., notes that rejections can be warranted when facts or medical judgments are in question. An example might be a patient who wants a doctor's notes about potentially excessive opioid use eliminated from the record. \"The patient may say I don't have a problem, I don't know what you're talking about, but the physician may think the patient has an issue,\" O'Brien said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother example might be a patient who wants a diagnosis eliminated from a medical record, because it might compromise her ability to get insurance coverage.

She's struggled with addiction for over 10 years, mostly to heroin. Then came the nightmare: She dreamt two men were attacking her baby while she could think only about drugs.\n\n\"In my mind I was thinking, 'If I can just get one hit, if I can get one line, I can save her,'\" she recalls, pausing before continuing, \"I woke up and I was panicking. How can a mother think like that?\"\n\nIt was a wake-up call. Bunker says she realized in that moment that heroin was \"evil\" and she resolved to get into treatment. In a lot of rural America, that's where the story could have ended.\n\nMany rural communities lack basic resources for substance abuse. There are fewer services available than in urban areas\u2014as many as 82 percent of rural Americans may live in counties that lack detoxification services, for example.\n\nLife And Health In Rural America You can find the other stories in our series about life in rural America here.\n\nBut Bunker was lucky. She found a community health center only about an hour from her home that recently expanded its addiction treatment services.\n\nThe clinic, NorthLakes Community Clinic,serves Medicaid and Medicare patients, and offers sliding scale payments for those with low-income. It expanded its addiction recovery program with the help of state and federal grants targeting opioid use. Though rural communities across the country struggle with addiction, community health centers like this one are modeling an approach to managing \u2014 and funding \u2014 treatment programs.\n\n\"We were seeing substance use disorders killing our community and we felt it was our job to step up,\" says Reba Rice, the clinic's CEO. \"We feel that all of our patients and community members deserve a life worth living.\"\n\nNot just opioids\n\nRice says addiction has torn apart rural communities in Northern Wisconsin in the last five years or so, with an increase in crime, problems in schools, trauma in families.\n\n\"It was amazing how many things we were seeing changed,\" she says. \"The way people looked at each other, the level people were willing to trust each other, and it was all about the changes that this disease makes on its victims\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Derek Montgomery for NPR Derek Montgomery for NPR\n\nA recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows that opioid and other drug abuse is the top health concern for rural Americans.\n\nNorthLakes has long provided primary care, dental and behavioral health services for low-income residents in Ashland, Wisconsin, and in several nearby towns. But as the opioid addiction problem worsened, Rice says she felt a responsibility as a health care provider to do something about it.\n\n\"We contributed to the problem so we needed to contribute to the solution,\" she says.Rice says opioids were just part of the puzzle: meth and alcohol were huge problems too. In fact, meth use in Wisconsin it has grown by 250 percent in recent years, according to the FBI. But new funds were becoming available for opioid treatment so the clinic applied for those \u2014 and is using them to build a comprehensive addiction treatment program that addresses all the substances people there struggle with.\n\nTo fund its expanded addiction treatment services, NorthLakes applied for and won a grant from the state of Wisconsin three years ago. It also got other federal grants intended for mental health and addiction. Central to their plan was hiring a physician who could lead the new program, and could prescribe the addiction treatment buprenorphine, known by the trade-name Suboxone.\n\nSuboxone treatment is one of the most effective ways to treat opioid addiction. But it is hard to find in rural areas, because only providers who've received special training are allowed to prescribe it. One 2015 study found that more than 80 percent of rural counties in the U.S. do not have a single physician able to prescribe it.\n\nNorthLakes found a physician who could prescribe it and more than that, who had a vision for a comprehensive addiction program.\n\nBuilding treatment capacity\n\nDr. Mark Lim says he is surprised he's here in this 8,000 person port-town on Lake Superior. He'd dreamed of living in a big city since he moved to the U.S. from the Philippines. When he got the call about the job, he was hesitant at first. \"I didn't know where that was on a map,\" he recalls.\n\nBut he saw this part of Wisconsin, where the death rate from drug and alcohol abuse is nearly twice as high as the state average, as a place where he could make a difference.\n\nLim's been board certified in addiction medicine since it was officially recognized as a subspecialty in 2016, but he's been working in the field since about 10 years ago when he started working in an addiction practice in Maine.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Derek Montgomery for NPR Derek Montgomery for NPR\n\nHe took the Wisconsin job, with one stipulation: He would start a program to address addiction as a whole. His expertise would be just one part of the treatment approach.\n\n\"If I'm just going to be the Suboxone doctor I'm not doing the full practice of addiction,\" Lim says.\n\nBecause while the medication can be effective for treating opioid use disorder, Lim says addiction is not just about opioids.\n\n\"Opioids are big right now,\" Lim says. \"But you have to work with alcohol too. You have to work with marijuana too. You have to work with methamphetamine, cocaine.\"\n\nRice says she and Lim developed the program together with community partners including educators, law enforcement and tribal leadership. \"We were successful because we had a vision for creating a program and so did he,\" Rice says.\n\nWhile it's rare to have a doctor who can prescribe Suboxone in a rural area like this one, Lim says only about 40 of his more than 200 patients take it. For the rest, his program relies on a combination of counseling, group therapy for addiction and underlying mental health issues, and case management. Staff help to remove barriers to being successful in recovery, helping patients with things like, transportation to the clinic, daycare for parents during therapy, and even job placements.\n\nThis kind of recovery program that combines clinical and counseling services is exactly what rural communities need, says John Gale of the Maine Rural Health Research Center.\n\n\"That's exactly the way it should be done. Because most people with a substance use disorder have co-occurring mental health and substance use problems,\" Gale says. \"If we take care of [a patient's] heroin problems and we don't treat the underlying mental health and substance abuse problems, they're going to go to go to alcohol, they're going to do something else.\"\n\nAnd while most of the attention and dollars are focused on opioid abuse right now, he says rural communities struggling to address addiction can use those resources to build a larger treatment capacity.\n\n\"They can use [those resources] to say, 'Wait a minute, let's build a treatment capacity for other people,' \" Gale says. \"And they begin to create a community where you can treat all sorts of substance use disorders.\"\n\nLindsay Bunker gets a ride to and from the NorthLakes clinic from a medical transportation company \u2014 it's about an hour's drive each way from the reservation. The clinic has a baby sitter who looks after her daughter when Bunker is in appointments. She makes the trip nearly every day.\n\n\"I love being here. I feel safe. I feel strong. I feel supported,\" Bunker says.\n\nBut she only sees Dr. Lim about once a week. Instead, like all of the patients here, she spends most of her time in one-on-one and group counseling sessions. There's the early relapse prevention group (from which Bunker recently graduated), then there's the relapse recovery group, the family group, the engaged-in-recovery group. There'll be a trauma group soon as well.\n\nBunker says those group sessions are really important in helping her stay in recovery.\n\n\"I get cravings and the cravings are being taken away with that medicine [suboxone]. But being here with my peers, I love it. I really do,\" Bunker says.\n\nAnd she says, recovery agrees with her.\n\n\"I look good, I feel good, I'm taking care of my kid,\" she says. \"I'm doing very well.\"\n\nBram Sable-Smith (@besables) is a health reporter based in Madison, Wis.", "keywords": ["fighting", "right", "addiction", "treatment", "program", "wisconsin", "opioid", "started", "bunker", "doctor", "rural", "health", "group", "community", "recruiting"], "summary": "For One Rural Community, Fighting Addiction Started With Recruiting The Right DoctorEnlarge this image toggle caption Derek Montgomery for NPR Derek Montgomery for NPRLindsay Bunker woke up from a nightmare.\nLife And Health In Rural America You can find the other stories in our series about life in rural America here.\nShe found a community health center only about an hour from her home that recently expanded its addiction treatment services.\nThough rural communities across the country struggle with addiction, community health centers like this one are modeling an approach to managing \u2014 and funding \u2014 treatment programs.\nNorthLakes found a physician who could prescribe it and more than that, who had a vision for a comprehensive addiction program."}, {"link": "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-12-genetic-physical.html", "published": "2018-12-10T12:35:17", "title": "Genetic changes associated with physical activity reported", "author": [], "text": "Credit: CC0 Public Domain Time spent sitting, sleeping and moving is determined in part by our genes, University of Oxford researchers have shown.

Credit: Christine Liu graphic For decades, psychologists have viewed the neurotransmitter dopamine as a double-edged sword: released in the brain as a reward to train us to seek out pleasurable experiences, but also a \"drug\" the constant pursuit of which leads to addiction.\n\nAccording to a new study from the University of California, Berkeley, that's only one face of dopamine. The flip side is that dopamine is also released in response to unpleasurable experiences, such as touching a hot tea kettle, presumably training the brain to avoid them in the future.\n\nThe yin-yang nature of dopamine could have implications for treatment of addiction and other mental disorders. In illnesses such as schizophrenia, for example, dopamine levels in different areas of the brain become abnormal, possibly because of an imbalance between the reward and avoidance circuits in the brain. Addiction, too, may result from an imbalance in reactions to pleasure and pain.\n\n\"In addiction, people only look for the next reward, and they will take a lot of risk to get the next shot of drugs of abuse,\" said Stephan Lammel, a UC Berkeley assistant professor of molecular and cell biology and the senior author of a paper describing the results in the journal Neuron. \"We currently do not know the neurobiological underpinnings of certain high-risk behaviors of individuals with addiction, such as sharing drug paraphernalia despite the proven risk of mortality and morbidity associated with it. An understanding of how drugs change neural circuits involved in aversion may have important implications for the persistent nature of drug-seeking behavior in the face of negative consequences.\"\n\nAlthough some neuroscientists have long speculated about dopamine's potential role in the signaling of aversive events, its dual personality remained hidden until recently because the neurons in the brain that release dopamine in response to rewards are embedded in a different subcircuit than the neurons that release dopamine in response to aversive stimuli.\n\nJohannes de Jong, the first author of the study, was able to simultaneously record from both dopamine subcircuits by implanting fiber optic cannulas in two brain regions\u2014separated by just a few millimeters\u2014using a new technology called fiber photometry.\n\n\"Our work delineates for the first time the precise brain circuitry in which learning about rewarding and aversive outcomes occurs,\" Lammel said. \"Having separate neuronal correlates for appetitive and aversive behavior in our brain may explain why we are striving for ever-greater rewards while simultaneously minimizing threats and dangers. Such balanced behavior of approach-and-avoidance learning is surely helpful for surviving competition in a constantly changing environment.\"\n\nThe newly discovered role for dopamine aligns with an increasing recognition that the neurotransmitter has quite different roles in different areas of the brain, exemplified by its function in voluntary movement, which is affected in Parkinson's disease. The results also explain earlier conflicting experiments, some of which showed that dopamine increases in response to aversive stimuli, while others did not.\n\n\"We have moved away from considering dopamine neurons as just a homogeneous cell population in the brain that mediates reward and pleasure to a more defined, nuanced picture of the role of dopamine, depending on where it is released in the brain,\" Lammel said.\n\nStudies of the dopamine-producing area of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area (center) have mostly focused on dopamine\u2019s role in reward. However, some evidence suggests that dopamine also plays a role in learning about aversive events, though the precise nature of the neural circuitry through which dopamine signals either reward or aversion is incompletely understood. In a new UC Berkeley study, researchers recorded from the axons of midbrain dopamine neurons that project to two areas of the nucleus accumbens (top) and discovered that there are two populations of neurons in the midbrain: the well-known circuit responding to positive motivational stimuli, but a parallel circuit responding to aversive events (blue). They also found that neurons from the lateral hypothalamus (bottom) were critical to priming aversion-sensing neurons to respond to painful stimuli. Credit: University of California - Berkeley Reward prediction errors\n\nMost of what is known about dopamine has been inferred from studies in rodents and monkeys, where researchers recorded from cells in a specific region of the brain that only contains reward-responsive dopamine neurons. It is possible, Lammel said, that through sampling biases, dopamine neurons that respond to aversive stimulation had been missed.\n\nAccording to the reigning \"reward prediction error hypothesis,\" dopamine neurons are activated and produce dopamine when an action is more rewarding than we expect, but they remain at baseline activity when the reward matches our expectations and show depressed activity when we receive less reward than predicted.\n\nDopamine changes neural circuits and trains the brain\u2014for better or worse\u2014to pursue the pleasurable and avoid the unpleasurable.\n\n\"Based on the reward prediction error hypothesis, the established tendency has been to emphasize dopamine involvement in reward, pleasure, addiction and reward-related learning, with less consideration of the involvement of dopamine in aversive processes,\" Lammel said.\n\nTo dissect the different dopamine subcircuits, de Jong and Lammel collaborated with the laboratory of Karl Deisseroth at Stanford University, who developed the fiber photometry technology a few years ago.\n\nFiber photometry involves threading thin, flexible fiber optic wires into the brain and recording fluorescent signals given off by neurons and their axons that release dopamine. The fluorescent markers are inserted into the neurons via a virus that targets only these cells.\n\nIn previous experiments in monkeys, Lammel said, scientists had recorded from dopamine cells without knowing where in the brain the cells' axons reached, which could be areas millimeters from the cell body. Working with mice, de Jong recorded simultaneously from dopamine axons in the lateral and medial regions of an area called the nucleus accumbens, considered an integral part of the brain's reward circuits. He thus captured the activity of cells whose axons reach into these regions from the dopamine areas in the midbrain, specifically the ventral tegmental area.\n\nTo their surprise, axons in the medial area released dopamine in response to an aversive stimulus\u2014a mild electrical shock to the foot\u2014while those in the lateral area released dopamine only after positive stimuli.\n\n\"We have two different subtypes of dopamine cells: one population mediates attraction and one mediates aversion, and they are anatomically separated,\" Lammel said.\n\nHe hopes that these findings can be confirmed in monkeys and humans, and lead to new approaches to understanding and treating addiction and other brain maladies.\n\nExplore further: Dopamine drives early addiction to heroin\n\nMore information: Johannes W. de Jong et al, A Neural Circuit Mechanism for Encoding Aversive Stimuli in the Mesolimbic Dopamine System, Neuron (2018).

First you\u2019ll need to prove you can afford it", "author": ["Jonel Aleccia", "Kaiser Health News", "Tns"], "text": "Most of the nation\u2019s more than 250 transplant centers require patients to verify how they will cover bills that can total $400,000 for a kidney transplant or $1.3 million for a heart, plus monthly costs that average $2,500 for anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life.\n\nWhen Patrick Mannion heard about the Michigan woman denied a heart transplant because she couldn\u2019t afford the anti-rejection drugs, he knew what she was up against.\n\nOn social-media posts of a letter that went viral last month, Hedda Martin, 60, of Grand Rapids, was informed that she was not a candidate for a heart transplant because of her finances. It recommended \u201ca fundraising effort of $10,000.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Mannion, of Oxford, Connecticut, learned he needed a double-lung transplant after contracting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive, fatal disease. From the start, hospital officials told him to set aside $30,000 in a separate bank account to cover the costs.\n\nMannion, 59, who received his new lungs in May 2017, reflected: \u201cHere you are, you need a heart \u2014 that\u2019s a tough road for any person,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then for that person to have to be a fundraiser?\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s case sparked outrage over a transplant system that links access to a lifesaving treatment to finances. But requiring proof of payment for organ transplants and postoperative care is common, transplant experts say.\n\n\u201cIt happens every day,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the New York University Langone Medical Center. \u201cYou get what I call a \u2018wallet biopsy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMost of the nation\u2019s more than 250 transplant centers, which refer patients to a single national registry, require patients to verify how they will cover bills that can total $400,000 for a kidney transplant or $1.3 million for a heart, plus monthly costs that average $2,500 for anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life, Caplan said. Coverage for the drugs is more scattershot than for the operation itself, even though transplanted organs will not last without the medicine.\n\nFor Martin, the social- media attention helped. Within days, she had raised more than $30,000 through a GoFundMe account, and officials at Spectrum Health confirmed she was added to the transplant waiting list.\n\nIn a statement, officials there defended their position, saying that financial resources, along with physical health and social well-being, are among crucial factors to consider.\n\n\u201cThe ability to pay for post-transplant care and lifelong immunosuppression medications is essential to increase the likelihood of a successful transplant and longevity of the transplant recipient,\u201d officials wrote.\n\nIn the most pragmatic light, that makes sense. More than 114,000 people are waiting for organs in the United States and fewer than 35,000 organs were transplanted last year, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS. Transplant centers want to make sure donated organs aren\u2019t wasted.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re receiving a lifesaving organ, you have to be able to afford it,\u201d said Kelly Green, executive director of HelpHopeLive, the Pennsylvania organization that has helped Mannion.\n\nHis friends and family have rallied, flocking to fundraisers that ranged from hair salon cut-a-thons to golf tournaments, raising nearly $115,000 so far for transplant-related care.\n\nAllowing financial factors to determine who gets a spot on the waiting list strikes many as unfair, Caplan said.\n\n\u201cIt may be a source of anger, because when we\u2019re looking for organs, we don\u2019t like to think that they go to the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s largely true.\u201d\n\nNearly half of the patients waiting for organs in the United States have private health insurance, UNOS data show. The rest are largely covered by the government, including Medicaid, the federal program for the disabled and poor, and Medicare.\n\nMedicare also covers kidney transplants for all patients with end-stage renal disease. But, there\u2019s a catch. While the cost of a kidney transplant is covered for people younger than 65, the program halts payment for anti-rejection drugs after 36 months. That leaves many patients facing sudden bills, said Tonya Saffer, vice president of health policy for the National Kidney Foundation.\n\nLegislation that would extend Medicare coverage for those drugs has been stalled for years.\n\nFor Alex Reed, 28, of Pittsburgh, who received a kidney transplant three years ago, coverage for the dozen medications he takes ended Nov. 30. His mother, Bobbie Reed, 62, has been scrambling for a solution.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pick up those costs,\u201d said Reed, whose family runs an independent insurance firm. \u201cIt would be at least $3,000 or $4,000 a month.\u201d\n\nPrices for the drugs, which include powerful medications that prevent the body from rejecting the organs, have been falling in recent years as more generic versions have come to market, Saffer said.\n\nBut \u201cthe cost can still be hard on the budget,\u201d she added.\n\nIt\u2019s been a struggle for decades to get transplants and associated expenses covered by insurance, said Dr. Maryl Johnson, a heart failure and transplant cardiologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual that there\u2019s 100 percent coverage for everything,\u201d said Johnson, a leader in the field for 30 years.\n\nGoFundMe efforts have become a popular way for sick people to raise money. About a third of the campaigns on the site target medical needs, the company said.\n\nBut when patients need to raise money, they should use fundraising organizations specifically aimed at those costs, transplant experts say, including HelpHopeLive, the National Foundation for Transplants and the American Transplant Foundation.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that funds generated through such general sites as GoFundMe will be used for the intended purpose. In addition, the money likely will be regarded as taxable income that could jeopardize other resources, said Michelle Gilchrist, president and chief executive for the National Foundation for Transplants (NFT).\n\nHer group, which helps 4,000 patients a year, has raised $82 million for transplant costs since 1983, she said. Such efforts usually involve a public-relations push. Still, 20 percent of the patients who turn to NFT each year fail to raise the needed funds, Gilchrist said.\n\nIn those cases, the patients don\u2019t get the organs they need. \u201cMy concern is that health care should be accessible for everyone,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cTen thousand dollars is a lot to someone who doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nEvery U.S. transplant center has a team of social workers and financial coordinators who help patients negotiate the gaps in their care. Lara Tushla, a licensed clinical social worker with the Rush University transplant program in Chicago, monitors about 2,000 transplant patients. She urges potential patients to think realistically about the costs they\u2019ll face.\n\n\u201cThe pharmacy will not hand over a bag full of pills without a bag full of money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not bill you.

It commonly involves the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis, according to the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cIt has a special place in my heart,\u201d Lee said of endometriosis and its primary symptom of pelvic pain, often associated with a woman\u2019s menstrual period.\n\n\u201cI started developing symptoms probably late teens \u2026 and not just, like, pain in terms of my (menstrual) cycling but in terms of just no energy and kind of flu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts at the Mayo Clinic, many women have cramps during their period, but those with endometriosis typically describe the pain as \u201cfar worse than usual\u201d and tend to report that the pain increases over time.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, most women do not even know that they have it and are misdiagnosed with other conditions, or it is just ignored,\u201d Lee said.\n\nCysts could form when endometriosis involves the ovaries, according to experts. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions \u2014 abnormal bands of fibrous tissue that can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.\n\n\u201cI just felt crappy from the beginning, and then it started progressing where it was more pain certain times of the month, and then I went to doctor to doctor, and they told me it was -- I was misdiagnosed with some digestive diseases, which was totally out of the question,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLena Dunham of the HBO series \u201cGirls\u201d was profiled last month for New York Magazine about her experience with endometriosis and how it is commonly dismissed as just a \u201cpainful period.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a chronic reproductive disease that affects several women ... that 1 in 10 women suffer from daily,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLike Lee, Dunham had a hysterectomy and consequently is unable to have biological children. And the 31-year-old actor/director is quite candid on social media about her ordeal, just like Lee.\n\n\u201cRecently, there has been a couple of commercials on TV drawing awareness to this disease in which the endo community is very thankful for. However, there needs to be more awareness,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cI had no clue what endometriosis meant when I was first officially diagnosed in the beginning of 2018, and the best way you can diagnose it is surgery and to actually go in and look around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors can just suspect it,\u201d Lee said of the reproductive disease. \u201cBut they\u2019ll determine it once you go under the knife.\u201d\n\nShe was \u201crelieved\u201d when she was finally diagnosed with endometriosis, which is especially common among women in their 30s and 40s and may make it difficult to get pregnant, according to the Office on Women\u2019s Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of times when you go through life and are not diagnosed with something, you feel really crappy \u2026 but now when you have a name for why and why you feel that way, you don\u2019t feel \u2018crazy,\u2019 I would say,\u201d Lee said.\n\nSupplemental hormones may reduce or eliminate the pain of endometriosis. Hormone medication may slow endometrial tissue growth and prevent new implants of endometrial tissue, but the painful symptoms may return after stopping treatment, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cWhen you go through many years, like I have been, of struggling with health and not feeling normal and not being able to do what you want to do and live life, having a relief -- regardless of what it is -- is something to be happy about,\u201d Lee said of her hysterectomy.\n\nLee even posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding a homemade sign that read \u201cGoodbye uterus at 25.\u201d She said she may someday start a local endometriosis support group.\n\n\u201cI do have a friend that started having the same symptoms as I did, and I thought that was very familiar, so then recently I said, \u2018You need to go to the doctor,\u2019 and lo and behold, she was diagnosed with endometriosis, too,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cBut I am feeling fabulous physically now \u2026 and it\u2019s hard to remember what I felt like before.\u201d\n\n7 signs of endometriosis\n\nPainful periods.

Something called the soy sauce colon cleanse is making headlines. The extremely dangerous fad reportedly left one woman brain dead, reminding us just how dangerous viral trends like this one can be.\n\nThe so-called cleanse suggests that drinking a liter of soy sauce within two hours will rid the body of toxins. Soy sauce is high in sodium, and the idea behind the fad is that \"toxins\" will follow the sodium as it passes through the body.\n\nRELATED: How Bad Is Soy Sauce for You Really?\n\nAccording to a video on the YouTube channel Chubbyemu, the 39-year-old woman who tried the cleanse went into cardiac arrest shortly after. The woman did begin to stabilize while in the hospital, but she continued to drift in and out of consciousness. When she woke up a few days later, she was unable to move, swallow, or speak and was diagnosed with central pontine myelinolysis, or severe nerve damage.\n\n\u201cOne of the roles of sodium is to regulate fluid balance in and around cells,\u201d says Cynthia Sass, Health contributing nutrition editor. \u201cWhen so much sodium is ingested so quickly, it completely throws off that balance, which in the case of brain cells can result in severe damage and dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first viral cleanse to go terribly wrong. Earlier this year, a woman claimed that drinking a gallon of a fermented blend of cabbage, water, and salt (called Jilly Juice) per day could cure Down syndrome, among other health conditions. People who tried it reported migraines, fever, numbness, high-blood pressure, and even stroke.\n\nRELATED: How a New Year\u2019s Detox Sent One Woman to the ER\n\nTo decipher if a health fad is ineffective but harmless or truly dangerous, Sass recommends consulting an unbiased health professional. \u201cAlso, listen to your gut instinct. If something seems extreme, way out of the norm, or sounds like it will be unpleasant or make you feel unwell, it probably will.\u201d\n\nThose with certain health conditions need to be especially cautious. \u201cPeople with type 1 or 2 diabetes should avoid cleanses, as well as anyone with a chronic illness, compromised immune system, those recovering from an injury, anyone following a therapeutic diet to manage a specific condition, and people with a history of disordered eating,\u201d Sass says.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind there isn\u2019t one definition of a cleanse. For some people, a cleanse could mean cutting out sugary, processed foods, and instead switching to fresh, whole foods and drinking more water. \u201cIf a cleanse is balanced, meaning it's not devoid of macro and micronutrients, and it's brief, it may be beneficial as a transition step to a long term healthier eating routine,\u201d she says.\n\nRELATED: This Is The Best Way to Detox Your Body\n\nBut very strict or extreme cleanses are another story. They tend to result in fatigue, irritability, rebound overeating, reduced immunity, and loss of muscle mass.

The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems.\n\nPaleo Diet Rules\n\nLeans primarily on meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds\n\nWild and/or pasture raised meat and produce is preferred\n\nSome proponents allow dairy and white potatoes\n\nThere\u2019s no Paleo, Inc. that\u2019s closely monitoring and assigning definitions to the term, but there are a lot of influential figureheads in the community like Mark Sisson, Chris Kresser, Robb Wolf, and Dr. Loren Cordain, who actually trademarked the words \u201cThe Paleo Diet.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, there remains some variance in how the diet is practiced by its adherents and what is and isn\u2019t generally considered acceptable to eat has changed somewhat throughout the years.\n\nWhole Foods\n\nThe central thesis is to eat like a caveman. Specifically, whatever was available to humans before the advent of agriculture came along and we started farming grains, legumes, and other foods that are restricted on the Paleo diet.\n\nThat means meat \u2014 ideally wild, free roaming, grass-fed, and/or pasture-raised \u2014 vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds. Under no circumstances should you consume wheat, corn, soy, or legumes.\n\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cmaybe\u201d category. Depending on who you ask, honey is fine, grass-fed dairy is acceptable, and white potatoes might be allowed. (This is in stark contrast to sweet potatoes, which belong to a different family of plants and are universally accepted on Paleo.) Some subsections of the Paleo community allow grain-like foods like quinoa and buckwheat and, extremely rarely, white rice. Note that this is quite uncommon: the party line is usually meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts.\n\n[Learn more about the differences between grass-fed and grain-fed beef here!]\n\nFats\n\nAdvocates are typically pro-fat: saturated fat and cholesterol are welcome additions to the plate. Processed seed and vegetable oils (like soybean, corn, and canola) are forbidden, though grass-fed butter and fruit oils like olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, and palm are typically allowed.\n\nThese categories may seem arbitrary \u2014 cavemen weren\u2019t exactly manufacturing avocado oil, after all \u2014 but the reasoning usually relies on the quality of fats present.\n\nThe argument largely hinges on polyunsaturated fats: processed oils and conventionally raised meat, dairy, and fish tend to be higher in Omega-6 fatty acids than their more Paleo-friendly counterparts. The kinds of Omega fatty acids we consume have been implicated in a range of health effects: consuming too much Omega-6 and not enough Omega-3 may increase inflammation, lower immunity, and maybe even affect mental health.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5) Research published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity in 2016, for example, found that in addition to the anti-inflammatory effects, Omega-3s play an \u201cimportant role on the structural changing of the brain\u201d and could impact depression risk, while noting that plenty of lifestyle and other factors also play an important role, here.(6)\n\nWhile Paleo advocates invariably promote the healthfulness of Paleo fats, it\u2019s worth pointing out that you can follow a lower fat, higher carb diet by combining foods like fish, chicken, sweet potato, bananas, and so on. Nonetheless, Paleo is grain free and leans toward higher fat foods overall.\n\n[Learn more in our complete guide to Omega-3s, mental health, and immunity.]\n\nThe Pros & Cons of Paleo\n\nPro: It\u2019s Nutrient Dense\n\nPaleo eliminates practically all \u201cjunk\u201d food in favor of nutrient dense whole foods.\n\n\u201cOne upside to the Paleo diet is that it can be nutritionally dense,\u201d says Leyla Shamayeva, MS, RD, a New York-based dietitian. \u201cIf you\u2019re emphasizing vegetables, fruit, lean meat, and nuts, you\u2019re getting important micronutrients and antioxidants.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the biggest upsides of Paleo: when so many foods are simply off limits and with your only food options as wild (or wild-ish) animals, vegetables, fruit, and nuts, you\u2019re not going to be filling your belly with sugar or processed food. You\u2019re going to be consuming a lot of vitamins and minerals. That\u2019s certainly not to say that processed food is always bad, only that the least nutrient dense junk foods you can buy are pretty much left off of the list.\n\nCon: It\u2019s Super, Super Restrictive\n\nThe Paleo diet is hard to stick to, which calls its usefulness into question.\n\nThe best diet is the one you can stick to, and the more restrictive it is, the harder a diet is to stick to. Avoiding so many common foods can lead to burnout, not to mention the fact that it will likely require more time preparing your own food \u2014 and some 90 percent of Americans don\u2019t like to cook.\n\n[If that sounds like you, check out our guide to the best Paleo meal delivery services.]\n\n\u201cFor most people, making an elimination diet your lifestyle diet isn\u2019t sustainable, especially in this case because whole grains and legumes are everywhere \u2014 and good for you!\u201d says Shamayeva. \u201cOmitting such foods with health benefits definitely draws the diet\u2019s usefulness into question.\u201d\n\nThe typical argument against grains and legumes is that they have \u201cantinutrients\u201d like phytic acid, which bind to minerals like magnesium and iron and make it harder to absorb them.(7)(8) However, this effect is either weakened or totally nullified if you\u2019re accompanying phytic acid with Vitamin C, plus phytic acid is an antioxidant that\u2019s been linked to lower risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and kidney stones.(9)(10)(11)(12)(13) There\u2019s probably no real reason to nix grains and legumes unless you have sensitivities.\n\nThe restrictiveness might also lead to feelings of guilt when you slip up, Shamayeva adds.\n\n\u201cElimination diets are very likely to lead to feelings of guilt, obsession, and pressure when you eat a food on the \u201cdo not eat\u201d list. Balance is key, and elimination diets don\u2019t leave much room for it.\u201d\n\nThen again, it does help a lot of people stay away from foods that make them prone to gain weight\u2026\n\nPro: Paleo Probably Helps With Weight Loss\n\nPaleo restricts food groups, which naturally restricts calories and typically leads to weight loss.\n\nSure, there\u2019s a lot to be said about how eating more anti-inflammatory foods might help with weight loss, but far and away the most important part of losing weight is calorie balance: eating less than you burn. The simple fact that you can\u2019t have that ice cream and can\u2019t eat a bag of chips means you\u2019re less likely to overeat on junk.\n\nOf course, you can always go ahead and make Paleo desserts that are jam packed with almond flour and coconut oil, which can easily add a fast thousand calories to your total. Generally speaking, though, fat and protein are more satiating than simple carbohydrates and quite a few studies have found that folks following Paleo diets wind up eating significantly less and losing weight, even when they\u2019re not tracking their intake.(14)(15)(16)\n\nCon: It\u2019s Expensive\n\nPasture-raised meat and organic produce are pricy.\n\nRice, beans, and potatoes are cheap, healthy, and plentiful. Grass-fed meat, coconut oil, and avocados are not. Sure, some Paleo advocates say you can just eat conventionally raised meat and battery hen eggs and non-organic produce, but even then it can be tough to eat a decent amount of calories while getting enough nutrition.\n\nCon: Paleo Might Not Be Ideal for Athletes\n\nPaleo cuts out many forms of carbohydrates, which are important for athletic performance.\n\nThe term \u201cPaleo\u201d doesn\u2019t expressly mean low carb, but with no grains, legumes, or processed sugar, it usually winds up pretty darn low in carbs. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if weight loss is your goal. But if you\u2019re an athlete\u2026\n\n\u201cAs an athlete, you should assess your goals and how Paleo specifics will impact them,\u201d says Shamayeva. \u201cThe diet tends to be very low in carbohydrates, meaning it may not be ideal for you unless you\u2019re paying close attention to things like fruit and starchy vegetables. Ask yourself what you\u2019re trying to achieve by following this diet and assess if it\u2019ll actually help you achieve it. Personally, I think that if eating rice, beans, and potatoes makes it easier to sustain your energy levels, or if you\u2019re miserable without your favorite yogurt or sugar in your coffee, you should eat them. You\u2019ll likely still achieve your goals when you have everything in balance.\u201d\n\nUnless you\u2019re doing a dedicated ketogenic diet, the standard athlete\u2019s diet typically has at least two grams of carbs for every gram of protein consumed, and that\u2019s pretty tough to hit without at least allowing for some rice. Sure, you can try sweet potatoes and bananas, but they provide a lot of fiber \u2014 not necessarily a bad thing, but you can wind up feeling uncomfortably full long before hitting your intake.\n\nAll of this depends on your individual goals and preferences, of course. Some people feel great on low carbs, others feel great on low fat. But broadly speaking, carbs are important for supporting activity levels and if you\u2019re doing a lot of activity, you might find it hard to eat enough Paleo friendly carbs to support performance and recovery.\n\n[Star CrossFit athlete Sarah Sigmundsottir is fully Paleo, but she includes some unusual carb sources like quinoa and buckwheat \u2014 she addresses them in this Road to the Games clip.]\n\nPro: Paleo May Help With Diabetes\n\nSome studies suggest beneficial effects for people with diabetes, but more research is needed.\n\nA small, randomized, cross-over study published in Cardiovascular Diabetology found that a Paleo diet resulted in \u201cstatistically significant\u201d lower values of triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index, along with a large (though just short of statistically significant) decrease in fasting plasma glucose.(17) A follow-up study also found that on a per calorie basis, the diet was more satiating than a traditional diabetes diet, albeit tougher to adhere to.(18)\n\nThat said, we don\u2019t have that many studies on Paleo and diabetes, plus many physicians remain convinced of the notion that saturated fat and cholesterol are bad for the heart. Since people with diabetes may be at a higher risk of heart problems, it seems unlikely that any diabetes advocacy groups will start promoting it. We\u2019re not doctors, though, and you should speak with a physician or your certified diabetes educator (CDE) before making changes to your diet.\n\nCons: The Jury\u2019s Still Out on Saturated Fat\n\nMost doctors remain convinced that saturated fat is bad for the heart, despite Paleo advocating otherwise.\n\nWe know this is a hugely controversial topic in nutrition and that in recent years, there have been scores of studies and meta-analyses concluding that saturated fat doesn\u2019t increase the risk of heart disease.(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)\n\nNonetheless, the official advice from the FDA and the American Heart Association is to limit saturated fat.\n\n\u201cPaleo makes it easy to skip the vegetables or make them the side and have meat be the plate\u2019s focus,\u201d says Shamayeva. \u201cProponents of the diet tend to be very pro saturated fat, and most dietitians and doctors agree that this isn\u2019t great for heart health.\u201d\n\nNow, you can eat nothing but broccoli and chicken breasts and olive oil and technically be Paleo. But again, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a Paleo dieter that doesn\u2019t regularly exceed the FDA\u2019s saturated fat limit of 10 percent of your daily calories.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nYou may have seen this list and taken away that Paleo has more pros than cons, but those pros (a lot of nutrients and a trimmer waist) can be so significant that they outweigh any potential cons. Which of these points matters the most depends on your individual preferences and your own body\u2019s response to the diet. We aren\u2019t for or against Paleo \u2014but speak with your physician before you make a big change to your diet.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Simopoulos AP.

By 2013, according to a study in Medical Care journal, the economic burden of the U.S. opioid crisis had already grown to about $78.5 billion.\n\nBrett Giroir, assistant secretary for health and senior adviser for opioid policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, told Yahoo Finance that there\u2019s \u201cno simple answer\u201d for how the epidemic began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a couple of decades to get us to this point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nGiroir explained that many factors play a part in this crisis, including \u201cthe overprescription and inappropriate prescription\u201d of opioid painkillers to patients, the \u201cavailability and importation\u201d of low-price, high-potency drugs, and \u201cthe role of state and society\u201d in allowing the opioid crisis to build.\n\nOpioid-related deaths have drastically increased since 2000.

However, what many don\u2019t realize is that \u201cthe people building these categories were the same people who were building Jim Crow racial segregation, campaigning for immigration restriction and implementing eugenic policies.\u201d\n\nA street scene in North Carolina in 1939.

Feeling dehydrated? Try electrolytes. Feeling sluggish? Exercise seems to help. But for some, the most devastating effects of a hangover are the emotional ones. In that realm, we have far fewer home remedies, but a recent study in Personality and Individual Differences, validating the morning-after ennui, pinpoints the kind of person who most likely has it worst.\n\nThe emotional toll of a hangover is sometimes called \u201changxiety,\u201d which is an umbrella term for a few different nasty feelings that plague the hungover brain. If you\u2019ve experienced it, you\u2019ll recognize the feeling as soon as you read the word. It might be a relentless stream of \u201cWhat did I do last night?\u201d fueled by spotty memories of the night before. For others, it\u2019s a persistent over-analysis of the events of the previous evening, driven by the nagging, unanswerable question: \u201cDid I make myself look stupid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnecdotally it resonates a lot with people.\u201d\n\nHowever it manifests, Beth Marsh, a research assistant at University College London\u2019s clinical pharmacology unit, explains to Inverse that her most recent paper adds credence to the idea that hangxiety is a real phenomenon that plagues some people more than others. Marsh, working with University of Exeter psychopharmacologist Celia Morgan, Ph.D., to design a study on 97 individuals, found that people who tended to be more shy reported more intense feelings of anxiety after a night of social drinking.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a firm explanation for why this correlation exists, but she has a working theory, based on the concept of \u201cpost-event processing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a characteristic of social anxiety where people have characteristic rumination or dwelling after a social event,\u201d Marsh tells Inverse. \u201cAlmost really re-running the experience in their mind with the kind of negative bias that comes from being shy or socially anxious. Thinking, \u2018Oh, I shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u2019 or \u2018Oh, that made me look stupid.\u2019\u201d\n\nOriginal Your Brain on Hangovers: What You Thought You Knew Is Wrong!\n\nSocially anxious people already feel this way, but Marsh believes that mixing alcohol into the equation exacerbates this type of rumination the next day. When it\u2019s hard to remember what happened the night before, there are more \u201cgaps\u201d in the narrative for the anxious mind to constantly re-run. When in doubt of what actually went down, a naturally self-critical person might assume the worst, thereby increasing the feelings of anxiousness that accompany a hangover even more.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a shy person who tends to fill those gaps in with negative things about yourself you might do that even more because there are more gaps,\u201d Marsh adds.\n\nAt this point, however, this explanation remains speculative. Hangovers in general are understudied, says Marsh, but their emotional and social dimensions are even trickier to pin down. Previous studies have tried to do this through interviews with hung over people. But Marsh\u2019s experiment, a \u201cnaturalistic study,\u201d investigated the emotional toll of one night of drinking and that of a night spent socializing in the participants\u2019 own homes.\n\nThis experimental design, she explains, gave her study a window into the social reasons that people drink in the first place and how that might play into the feelings of anxiety the next day. Here, she found that getting drunk only \u201cmarginally\u201d decreased anxiety in her shy individuals in the moment, but their anxiety was significantly higher the next day.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, it resonates a lot with people,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cIs that tradeoff of that brief reduction in anxiety once you\u2019ve had the drink worth it the morning after?\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Marsh will try to find a way to test her theory about alcohol\u2019s effects on post-event processing. But the key to a good experiment, she says, is to try to replicate all the aspects of drinking \u2014 from the actual alcohol consumption to the social dynamics at play.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young\n\nA biopharmaceutical company hoping to disrupt the cannabis extraction market is claiming some Canadian licensed producers are selling cannabis oils that are tantamount to placebos.\n\nCannabis oils have surged in popularity over the last couple years, but for medical patients\u2014many of whom don\u2019t want to smoke anything\u2014they\u2019ve become of particular importance.\n\nScientus Pharma is a Whitby, Ontario-based pharmaceutical company that will soon bring to market cannabis oils and gel capsules strictly for medical patients. The company is critical of the way LPs currently decarboxylate their cannabis to make oils\u2014decarboxylation is the process through which the THC or CBD in raw cannabis is activated. If you\u2019re smoking or vaping, the heat causes the decarboxylation. But with oils, that process needs to take place during the extraction process.\n\nScientus recently patented its decarboxylation method, which it says will be a game changer in terms of standardizing the potency of weed oils; it claims it can achieve 99.9 percent decarboxylation every time. In a nutshell, Scientus is saying the industry standard\u2014using a carbon dioxide extractor to decarboxylate weed and then turn it into oil\u2014has too many variables and as a result some oils don\u2019t have the amount of active THC or CBD they claim to have on the label. That means that a patient won\u2019t necessarily be getting the effects they think they\u2019ll be getting.\n\n\u201c[Patients] are paying $300 to $500 a month for that product and it\u2019s not doing anything for them,\u201d said Har Grover, chairman and CEO of Scientus.\n\nHowever, both Health Canada and the organization representing Canadian LPs maintained that LPs are subject to the strictest regulations in the world.\n\nLakshmi Kotra, a senior scientist at Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, and Hance Clarke, medical director of the Pain Research Unit at the Toronto General Hospital, are both scientific advisors for Scientus. They are in the midst of conducting a clinical trial funded by the company that is in part analyzing samples of cannabis oil given to them by pain patients\u2014all of the oil samples come from licensed producers.\n\nTheir preliminary findings show that of 14 THC oils listing full potency, only two actually had full potency. In one of the oils, less than 20 percent of it contained activated THC. Of 10 samples of CBD oil that claimed to be 100 percent potent, only three were fully potent. One of them had no activated CBD.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a placebo,\u201d said Grover.\n\nPreliminary data from a Scientus Pharma-funded study shows that not all cannabis oils are fully activated.\n\nSamples of CBD oil from Canadian LPs, including one that has no active CBD, in this slide from a preliminary study.\n\nKotra noted that with any other medicine, you would take a tablet and find exactly what the medicine is supposed to contain, but with cannabis oils, there are patients \u201cgetting 80 percent inactive substance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s totally unregulated and from a patient\u2019s point of view, they have to take five times more of the oil to get the same effect. Next time they go to the shop if they pick up a fully active oil, now the same dosing is not working.\u201d\n\nBut how is this even possible?\n\nThe doctors both noted that science for cannabis as medicine isn\u2019t advanced enough yet, and that it\u2019s not yet at a place where it can truly be considered medicine, because there\u2019s a lack of standardization. They said that when it comes to labelling, LPs include both THCA and THC as THC and CBDA and CBD as CBD\u2014but THCA and CBDA aren\u2019t activated. That doesn\u2019t matter when someone is smoking or vaping, but it does with oils that are simply ingested.\n\n\u201cWe have reasonable doubt to say that what\u2019s reported on the label may not match what\u2019s inside the bottle,\u201d said Kotra.\n\nReached by VICE, Health Canada spokesman Andr\u00e9 Gagnon said it can\u2019t comment on the study because it doesn\u2019t know its methodology. However, Gagnon said the production of cannabis and cannabis oils are \u201csubject to some of the most stringent requirements in the world to protect the health and safety of Canadians.\u201d\n\nPart of those requirements including testing for potency levels before products can be approved by quality assurance.\n\nLPs test their products either in house or using third-party testing.\n\nKotra and Hance said their study is one of a kind, and implied they don\u2019t think Health Canada is caught up to their research, hence not requiring testing on the level of decarboxylation in oils.\n\nAllan Rewak, executive director of the Cannabis Council of Canada, a national organization of licensed producers, told VICE Scientus claims about LP weed oil are \u201cshockingly bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is quite surprising that an academic study would be shared to the media prior to being published in this fashion. It is very unusual and most likely is related to a corporate strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the source material cannabis oil will often change, and that results in ranges of THC and CBD in products but he said the THC content, as tested by third-party labs, is accurate on the the label.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to build a better mousetrap and I suspect that\u2019s what this company is trying to do\u2026 but it is concerning to be blunt, cause we really believe in medical science and the medical industry. We believe in supporting the medical patients.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated Health Canada\u2019s messaging about how vigorous regulations are for LPs, and noted that \u201cwe have 300,000 Canadians who have found benefit from medicinal cannabis both in dried form and oil form.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have done all of our research by the book,\u201d said Clarke.\n\nJordan Sinclair, vice-president of communications for LP Canopy Growth, told VICE it\u2019s difficult to comment without knowing the details of the study, which should be complete in the next two to three months. But he said the discrepancies found in the study could be due to human error i.e. mislabelling, or a difference in testing gear being used in the study versus by LPs.\n\nHe said Canopy tests for both THC and THCA after the oils are packaged to ensure accuracy and that people are getting what they pay for.\n\nPatient advocate Tracy Curley told VICE the researchers claims are in line with what she\u2019s heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard of a discrepancy in dosage depending on what product client is using even though the label say that they are very similar,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter.\n\nSign up for the VICE Canada Newsletter to get the best of VICE Canada delivered to your inbox.", "keywords": ["placebos", "producers", "licensed", "oils", "medical", "lps", "oil", "vice", "thc", "weed", "study", "cbd", "canada", "selling", "researchers", "cannabis"], "summary": "THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris YoungA biopharmaceutical company hoping to disrupt the cannabis extraction market is claiming some Canadian licensed producers are selling cannabis oils that are tantamount to placebos.\nScientus Pharma is a Whitby, Ontario-based pharmaceutical company that will soon bring to market cannabis oils and gel capsules strictly for medical patients.\nTheir preliminary findings show that of 14 THC oils listing full potency, only two actually had full potency.\nOf 10 samples of CBD oil that claimed to be 100 percent potent, only three were fully potent.\nSign up for the VICE Canada Newsletter to get the best of VICE Canada delivered to your inbox."}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181210101930.htm", "published": "2018-12-10T16:39:43", "title": "Hair color gene study sheds new light on roots of redheads' locks", "author": [], "text": "Scientists have discovered eight genes linked to red hair, helping to solve a mystery of how redheads inherit their flaming locks.\n\nThe study -- which also sheds light on blondes and brunettes -- is the largest genetic study of hair colour to date.\n\nIt had been thought that red hair is controlled by a single gene, called MC1R.

A recent study deepens our understanding of how Parkinson's disease begins in the gut.\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition.\n\nBrain cells in the substantia nigra \u2014 a region vital for motor control \u2014 slowly break down.\n\nThe most common Parkinson's symptoms are rigidity and tremor.\n\nOther symptoms include some other physical changes and some psychological issues.\n\nThe condition is most common in older adults. Therefore, as the population grows older, Parkinson's is likely to become an even greater problem.\n\nTo date, however, there is no cure and no way to prevent the disease from progressing.\n\nA protein called alpha-synuclein plays a pivotal role in Parkinson's; it clumps together to form part of larger structures called Lewy bodies. These appear to kill brain cells.\n\nParaquat and Parkinson's risk\n\nScientists still do not know exactly why Parkinson's disease occurs in some people but not others, but they are confident that both genes and the environment are involved.\n\nA potential risk factor that has sparked debate is exposure to a herbicide called paraquat. Once widely used, the United States banned it in 2007.\n\nExperiments have demonstrated that administering paraquat can cause Parkinson's-like symptoms, or Parkinsonism, in rodents. However, the levels of pesticide the scientists used in those experiments are way above what a human would ever experience in reality.\n\nRecently, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey wanted to find out whether or not contact with paraquat \u2014 at realistic levels of exposure \u2014 could, indeed, increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe scientists wanted to understand exactly how this chemical could travel from the stomach to impact protein buildup in the brain. They have now published their results in the journal NPJ Parkinson's Disease.\n\nBeginning in the gut\n\nSpecifically, the scientists were interested in testing the theory that paraquat, once in the stomach, causes alpha-synuclein to be misfolded and then helps it travel to the brain.\n\nScientists believe that alpha-synuclein runs along the vagus nerve, which itself runs between the stomach and the brain. In fact, recent studies have shown that the vagus nerve has a direct connection with the substantia nigra, making it a prime suspect in Parkinson's disease.\n\nThis direct link also helps explain why digestive problems often precede the motor symptoms of Parkinson's by several years.\n\nTo investigate, the researchers fed rats small doses of paraquat for 7 days. They also fed them lectins, which are sugar-binding proteins present in foods such as raw vegetables, eggs, and grains.\n\nManufacturers of some types of medication also use lectins; they act as chaperones, helping deliver drugs to the brain or stomach. In the past, scientists have shown an association between taking drugs that contain lectin and developing Parkinsonism. However, they have not yet proven a causal link.\n\nThe investigators believe that lectins might form the link between paraquat and Parkinson's.\n\nAfter the 7-day trial, the team waited a further 14 days before testing the animals. The scientists then assessed motor function and looked for other markers of Parkinson's. As expected, they identified Parkinson's-related changes.\n\nTo check their findings, the researchers explored further.\n\n\"We administered levodopa, which is a common medication for Parkinson's disease. We saw a return to almost normal types of motor responses, which was a clear indication that we were looking at some sort of Parkinsonism.\" Senior study author Prof. Alberto Travagli\n\nThe role of the vagus nerve\n\nIn another arm of the study, the team disconnected the vagus nerve from the stomach of some rats before beginning the 7-day intervention.\n\nThese animals did not develop Parkinsonism, demonstrating that the vagus nerve is the probable route the misfolded alpha-synuclein takes.\n\nAs study co-author Prof. Thyagarajan Subramanian explains:\n\n\"We were able to demonstrate that if you have oral paraquat exposure, even at very low levels, and you also consume lectins [...] then it could potentially trigger the formation of this protein \u2014 alpha-synuclein \u2014 in the gut.

Tried by Jenna Jameson, Savannah Guthrie, and Halle Berry, this diet works by sending the body into ketosis, a physiological state that occurs when your body is forced to burn fat cells instead of glucose (due to the absence of carbs) as a form of energy.\n\n\u201cIn order to reach ketosis, you have to keep carbohydrate intake to a minimum, so you need to eat about 75% of your calories from fat, 20% from protein, and about 5% from carbs,\u201d says Julie Upton, MS, RD, co-founder of Appetite for Health.\n\nAnd when the body uses the glucose that's stored in our muscles as glycogen for energy, the scale goes down. \"Our muscles store about 3 grams of water for every gram of glycogen, meaning we can lose quite a bit of weight right away when we tap into glycogen stores for fuel,\" says GH Nutrition Director Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN. \"That's why someone who loses weight in 'just one week!' from a low-carb plan is likely losing water weight, not necessarily real weight that stays off over time, but the immediacy can be motivating at the beginning of a weight-loss diet.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nUpton explains that keto-approved meals contain fish (salmon, oysters, scallops), meat and poultry (pork, lamb, steak, and yes, bacon!), eggs, nuts, non-starchy vegetables (spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes), fats and oils (butter, mayo, avocado oil, ghee), and high-fat dairy (full-fat yogurt, heavy cream, cream cheese, hard and soft cheese). Berries and artificial sweeteners can be eaten sparingly.\n\nFoods on the banned list include most fruits (apples, bananas, peaches, oranges), grains (breads, pastas, cereals, and any foods made with wheat, rice, oats, or corn), legumes (all beans), root veggies (potatoes, winter squash, turnips), some oils (canola, soybean, peanut), and anything with added sugar (desserts, honey, ketchup, BBQ sauce, sweetened beverages), alcohol, and absolutely nothing low-fat.\n\nAtkins Diet 101\n\nGetty Images Enrique D\u00edaz / 7cero\n\nWith Rob Lowe as the latest (and first male) spokesperson for this widely known low-carb diet, it\u2019s no wonder people are (once again) taking the Atkins route. \"Atkins is a diet where you replace many of your carbohydrates with protein and healthy fats \u2014 meaning foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats,\" Upton says. (FYI: The diet was created by a cardiologist named Robert C. Atkins back in the '60s.)\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe diet is divided into four phases where carbs are slowly re-introduced as the stages go on. Phase 1 is the most drastic since it's about sending your body into ketosis with a daily intake of protein, fat, and 20 to 25 grams carbs \u2014 where about 15 grams should be from veggies. Phase 2 boosts the daily carb intake to 25 to 50 grams and more carb-filled foods are added to the diet, such as berries, melon, and legumes. Phase 3 ups the daily carb intake to 50 to 80 grams \u2014 where starchy veggies, more fruits, and whole grains are added to the plan. And Phase 4 increases the daily carb intake to 80 to 100 grams.\n\nAtkins has created a more relaxed plan (called Atkins 40) where Phase 1 begins with a daily carb intake of 40 grams. Both versions nix simple carbohydrates (bread, bagels, cereal, juice, dried fruit), starches (white pasta, white potatoes, white rice, corn, chips), and anything with added sugars.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Keto and Atkins\n\nGenerally speaking, eating fewer carbs can be healthful since the typical follower of the Western diet takes in more than the daily recommended amount of carbohydrates (about half of our calories per day, where at least half of these grains derive from whole grains, according to the 2015-2020 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans).\n\nHowever, London stresses that any diet ultra-low in carbs \u2014 such as keto and phase 1 of Atkins \u2014 can result in some unwanted short-term side effects (like constipation and bad breath), as well as some serious long-term ones (increased risk of osteoporosis, kidney and liver issues, and decreased immune function). Also, one large study presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2018 found that low-carb diets should be \u201cavoided\u201d since followers are at a greater risk of death due to heart disease, stroke, and cancer.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nUpton highlights the additional cardiovascular complications that may arise from the keto lifestyle. \u201cThe keto diet doesn't emphasize healthy fats \u2014 it just promotes any type of fat, like heavy cream, butter, and lard,\u201d she explains.\n\nLondon also feels that a super-restrictive plan like keto sets you up for failure since one innocent mom\u2019s night out will result in immediate weight gain. \u201cKeto diets rely on an extreme technique to (temporarily) move the scale down a few pounds, and basically eliminates all joy associated with eating real food and living life,\u201d she adds.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t as much the case with Atkins. \"What's great about Atkins 40 is that it encourages choosing smarter carbohydrates in place of simple added sugars from sneaky sources and emphasizes polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, which are two evidence-backed strategies for better health and long-term weight loss,\" London says. \"I also like the emphasis on whole-food sources of fiber, which makes the plan more realistic than extreme eating plans that almost entirely eliminate a food group.\"\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLondon and Upton both find more promising results from following the Atkins plan, but this diet is not realistic for everyone. \"You may find yourself dreaming of bagels instead of feeling good on the plan,\" London adds. \"That said, Atkins' reincorporation of starches and the plan's increased veggie intake can be super effective, and the maintenance phase can feel much more attainable for the long term.\"\n\nFor anyone looking to consume less carbs in their regime, London shares this advice:\n\n\"Fill up on veggies of all kinds \u2014 starchy and non-starchy \u2014 choose lean protein, low-fat dairy, and nuts and legumes as much as possible, and allow for the occasional dessert or indulgence (about 150 to 200 calories daily). Hardcore restrictions can backfire big time, so go easy on yourself!\"\n\nSince eating preferences and dietary needs vary from person to person, it\u2019s advised to check with your doctor before starting any new weight-loss program.", "keywords": ["carbs", "keto", "right", "intake", "daily", "diet", "atkins", "phase", "grams", "versus", "plan", "according", "pick", "weight", "dieticians"], "summary": "Keto Diet 101Getty Images ThitareeSarmkasatIn short, the ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, ultra-low-carb plan.\nAtkins Diet 101Getty Images Enrique D\u00edaz / 7ceroWith Rob Lowe as the latest (and first male) spokesperson for this widely known low-carb diet, it\u2019s no wonder people are (once again) taking the Atkins route.\nAtkins has created a more relaxed plan (called Atkins 40) where Phase 1 begins with a daily carb intake of 40 grams.\n\u201cThe keto diet doesn't emphasize healthy fats \u2014 it just promotes any type of fat, like heavy cream, butter, and lard,\u201d she explains.\nThe Bottom LineLondon and Upton both find more promising results from following the Atkins plan, but this diet is not realistic for everyone."}, {"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/are-dentists-hooking-patients-on-opioids-2018-12-05", "published": "2018-12-09T12:09:00", "title": "Are dentists hooking patients on opioids?", "author": ["Andrew Keshner"], "text": "Wisdom tooth extractions might lead to more suffering that could, in theory, last years.\n\nThat\u2019s according to new study that says the procedures may end in opioid abuse for some patients. The study released this week found an almost 7% increase in the risk of persistent opioid use after reviewing 2015 prescription records for dental patients between the age of 16 and 25.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest that a substantial proportion of adolescents and young adults are exposed to opioids through dental clinicians,\u201d the JAMA Internal Medicine study said. \u201cUse of these prescriptions may be associated with an increased risk of subsequent opioid use and abuse.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s study is another reminder on the risks related to the painkiller medication. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said opioid abuse was partly to blame as average American life expectancy edged down to 78.6 years in a third year of slight average life expectancy decreases. The CDC noted two-thirds of the 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 involved opioids, which include heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone.\n\nThe latest study started with a data set of almost 750,000 people aged between 16 to 25, which happens to be around the time wisdom teeth become a problem.\n\nWithin that group, nearly 13% of the patients received one or more opioid prescriptions. When patients received the powerful painkillers, dentists were the ones writing the prescriptions in 30.6% of the cases.\n\nThe study scrutinized 14,888 patients who received opioids through dental work, and compared them to a group double that size, which didn\u2019t get the painkillers.\n\nDr. Alan Schroeder, the study\u2019s lead author, said the findings left him with questions about the amount of opioids prescribed and why so many wisdom tooth extractions were happening at all. Patients with the painkillers received about 20 pills on average and such a large number could tempt misuse or diversion of unneeded pills, he said.\n\nSchroeder, an associate research chief in the pediatric hospital medicine division at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford, credited dentists for reducing their opioid prescription amounts over time. Still, he added, \u201cI think we have a lot more work to do.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what they found:\n\n\u2022 6.9% of the group with received a subsequent opioid prescription in the following 90 days to a year. Before their first prescriptions, they didn\u2019t have any record of opioid us in the preceding 12 months earlier. By contrast, just .1 % the control group ended up with an opioid prescription in the same timeframe.\n\n\u2022 5.8% of group exposed to opioids then had at least one encounter with medical providers who gave an opioid abuse\u2013related diagnosis. The same thing happened for a mere 0.4% of the control group.\n\nResearchers acknowledged the study used diagnosis codes, so some misclassification could have occurred. Also, as with all studies, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish between correlation and causation.\n\nDentist have been giving fewer opioid prescriptions in recent years, according the American Dental Association. Responding to the JAMA study, they noted dentists wrote 18.5 opioid prescriptions in 2012. Five years later, they wrote 18.1 million prescriptions. \u201cThis is progress, and we know there is still more we can do,\u201d the ADA said.\n\nThe dental association said more research supports its policy of advising dentists to prescribe other medication rather than opioids. \u201cThe ADA continues to be dedicated to raising awareness and taking action on the opioid public health crisis,\u201d the group said.\n\nNevertheless, they said more attention was needed for the links between wisdom tooth extractions and opioids during postoperative care.\n\nThe good news: Efforts are being made to cut down on opioid prescriptions. The CDC said opioid prescription rates have been decreasing since 2012; still the potency remains three times higher than prescriptions in 1999.\n\nAs for younger patients, research last month said medical professionals have halved their opioid prescriptions to children and teens between 2012 and 2017.\n\nGet a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

So, I was told what happened, but I don't know. I mean, you're not supposed to be able to pull guys down if that's what they did.\"\n\nWith the Seahawks leading 6-0, replays clearly showed Wagner putting his hands on the shoulders of teammates on both sides of him as he jumped into the backfield.\n\nHe then landed on his feet, extended his arms and blocked Vikings place-kicker Dan Bailey's 47-yard attempt.\n\nHad Allen enforced the rule, the Vikings would have received a first down at the Seahawks' 14-yard line with 5 minutes, 38 seconds remaining. Instead, the Seahawks gained possession at their 37-yard line and drove for a game-clinching touchdown.\n\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll acknowledged the controversy but said it was fitting Wagner made the play after last week, when he had an interception, touchdown, sack, forced fumble and fumble recovery but no block in a 43-16 win over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"It was almost poetic after last week's game that Bobby would get the chance to block the field goal and he pulled it off and did it.

The 27-year-old Realmuto also isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2020 season.\n\nThe Marlins obviously want a hefty return for Realmuto, and that's presumably where the Yankees come in. They have a stronger young talent base than the Mets do, and they can put together a package that could give the Marlins what they're looking for. It seems likely that Miguel Andujar would be involved as part of it.\n\nAt the same time, the Yankees are looking to add another starting pitcher to the fold, especially since Sonny Gray is almost certain to be traded this winter. Syndergaard certainly fits the bill. The 26-year-old right-hander is one of the hardest throwers in the game, and he boasts a career ERA+ of 132 and a K/BB ratio of 4.94 across parts of four big-league seasons. His problem has been injuries -- only once has Syndergaard managed to log a qualifying number of innings in a season. Framed another way, though, he's topped 150 innings in three of his four seasons, so perhaps the reward outweighs the risk.\n\nWhile new Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen has been hellbent on contention since taking the reins, the sight of Syndergaard in Yankee pinstripes would surely be jarring and unpopular for Mets fans.

That will probably take some time, but it\u2019s a development the Lakers will need if they want to be more consistent.\n\nIn what was the 31st and final matchup between James and Dwyane Wade, it was James who walked away with bragging rights for the rest of time (unless some kind of trade sends Wade to a team that might face the Lakers again at some point this season). James finished with just shy of a triple-double (28 points, 12 assists and 8 rebounds). Wade had a nice run in the second half but was pretty quiet the rest of the game.\n\nLate in the game, both James and Wade had chances to either put the game away or take a late lead. They both missed, but the crowd (that had earlier given Wade a standing ovation) was definitely into the moment, especially as James guarded Wade to force a miss on the game\u2019s final possession.\n\nOne consistent complaint from this one were the lineups Luke went with for important chunks of the quarters.

However, the argument certainly could be made that Ferguson deserves the nod first. He is currently on an 11-fight win streak and was recently stripped of his interim lightweight title due to injury.\n\nLightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is awaiting punishment for his involvement in the post-UFC 229 melee against Conor McGregor\u2019s team. He won\u2019t be booked until his punishment from the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) is settled. With that being said, this puts the lightweight title picture \u2013 more specifically, Ferguson and Poirier \u2013 at a stall.

McGregor knocked Poirier out in their first meeting at featherweight back in 2014. The Irishman has gone on to become one of the biggest stars in all of sports, and a former two-division UFC champion. Meanwhile, Poirier has thrived since moving up to lightweight, propelling himself into title contention:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun fight for the fans and for both of our careers,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cAnd it makes sense.

The team gave up the 2019 first-round draft pick to Oakland for him (Raiders fans aren't exactly thrilled with how the move is turning out, as one might expect). He's been the centerpiece of the team's transformation during this five-game winning streak that is near certain to lead to the NFC East title.\n\n\"The team camaraderie here, it's amazing,\" Cooper said Monday. \"We play with fire every week, we practice hard, we believe in ourselves. It's just amazing. I can't put it into words how I want right now.\" Cooper is not the most demonstrative player, especially at a position known for some ego. He hasn't become frustrated when the football is not getting to him. All but one of his 10 catches against the Eagles came in the second half, and all of his touchdowns came from the fourth quarter on. \"I just want to be the best, I want to be the best receiver to play the game,\" Cooper said. \"And I don't know how people want to see that lived out in my life. But I feel like I have a pretty good idea on how to get there, in terms of me coming to work every day, studying, doing all the things necessary to be that guy. As far as personality wise, I'm not going to change who I am.\"\n\nIt defies logic! Cowboys' Dak Prescott did 3 things vs. Eagles that lead to losses in the NFL -- and somehow won\n\nSaid coach Jason Garrett on Monday: \"He's a very serious-minded guy. He doesn't talk a lot. He certainly doesn't talk a lot on the field. When he talks, people listen because he usually has something really good to say. \"And I think he's mature. He's poised. And you said it, I think he's patient. ... We want to get him the ball. He's a really good football player. So we'll continue to try to do that. His patience is important, because really what that patience is -- you don't get frustrated, you just stay patient and keep doing your job. Then, you start getting the chances and you cash in on them. That's certainly what happened yesterday.\" On Cooper's 75-yard touchdown scoring play in the fourth quarter, he'd told quarterback Dak Prescott about taking advantage of the go-route. He was elated when Prescott changed the play call and went for it. The relationship is still a work in progress. \"It's only been a month,\" Cooper said. \"We talk football, certain plays that we can get better on and things like that. But we're not going to know each other quite as well as if we'd been together from the beginning of the season. That's something that just takes time.\" Cooper spent part of the day after his mega performance in the small Texas town of Joshua, outside of Fort Worth. He helped surprise the Webster Family, which won Sleep Number beds through a sweepstakes by Blue Star Families. Justin Webster, who has four young children with his wife, Ashleigh, served in the Army and now is a member of the National Guard.\n\nThe day after his big game, Amari Cooper is out in Joshua, Texas.

To be able to put a smile on this family's face, it means everything. To hand them my jersey, Dak's jersey, it's amazing.\"\n\nThe Webster family moved here recently from Arizona.

The Rams star plays all over the defensive line, but the Bears were confident Daniels could hold his own against Donald, especially with some help.\n\nThe results in the Bears\u2019 15-6 victory affirmed that. The game plan hatched by offensive line coach Harry Hiestand and coach Matt Nagy was a winner, and Daniels, a second-round pick from Iowa, looks like a future stalwart on the offensive line.\n\nThe Bears solo blocked Donald on 33 of his 71 snaps. Many of those were very quick throws or runs away from him. Of those 33 solo blocks, 18 were by Daniels and 15 by right guard Bryan Witzmann, who performed much better than he did the previous week against the Giants.\n\nDaniels blocked Donald with help from center Cody Whitehair on 10 snaps. Left tackle Charles Leno helped eight times, running back Jordan Howard twice and fullback Michael Burton once.\n\nPhotos of every Bears touchdown scored during the 2018 season.\n\nWhat the Bears were trying to avoid was clear on a handful of plays, like the third-and-2 Howard run from from the Bears\u2019 45-yard line late in the second quarter \u2014 the play before the fourth-down fire drill that wasn\u2019t after right tackle Bobby Massie knocked over line judge Carl Johnson. With a swim move, Donald split Witzmann and Massie and stuffed Howard for a 1-yard gain.\n\nThe Bears were first-and-10 from their own 12-yard line in the third quarter when Donald knifed inside Daniels and stopped running back Taquan Mizzell for 1 yard. On a wide-receiver screen on the next snap, Donald raced past Witzmann and hit quarterback Mitch Trubisky just after the ball was released.\n\nThat was about it for Donald highlights, though, as the Bears got four hands on him much of the time.\n\nDaniels has been technically sound since he was inserted into the lineup and advanced for just turning 21. He has displayed good play strength, but his intelligence showed here. He proved he could use his help, which isn\u2019t always as easy it sounds, especially against a star like Donald.\n\nFor instance, on plays in which Daniels had help to his inside from Whitehair, if Daniels fell for a hard inside move, it would expose the outside and let a player with Donald\u2019s explosiveness easily wreck his way into the backfield with no opportunity for the center to help. Daniels knew where his help was and played to it, and when he didn\u2019t have aid, he held his own.\n\n\u201cThe O-line did a great job keeping him in check,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cThat's what we wanted to do. He didn\u2019t have any game-destructive plays that he usually causes.\u201d\n\nAfter his rough game in the overtime loss in New Jersey, Witzmann looked more comfortable, and that was a positive sign. He\u2019s getting more comfortable with the small-scheme things the Bears are doing, and playing at home probably makes more of a difference for offensive linemen than any other position. They\u2019re not forced to go on a silent count, which can give the defensive linemen a step.\n\nTaking the air out: With passing more prolific than ever and the Rams boasting one of the best throwing games in the NFL, neither quarterback had success downfield. Rams QB Jared Goff was uncomfortable in the pocket all night and never found a rhythm with his feet. He was rushed and often jumpy, and the stats reflected that. He completed 2 of 14 passes on balls that traveled 10 or more yards in the air beyond the line of scrimmage, gaining only 26 yards while throwing three interceptions.\n\nTrubisky didn\u2019t fare a lot better downfield; his successful throws were quick reads for short and intermediate passes. He completed 1 of 8 passes 10 or more yards downfield for 17 yards with two interceptions.\n\nbmbiggs@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @BradBiggs\n\nBrad Biggs' 10 thoughts on the Bears' 15-6 win over the Rams \u00bb\n\nBears coach Matt Nagy apologizes to official for outburst after botched substitution: 'I told them that they did the right thing' \u00bb\n\nNBC's Cris Collinsworth on the Bears: 'I'm really impressed' \u00bb", "keywords": ["rams", "witzmann", "daniels", "donald", "plays", "prevent", "bears", "rewind", "yards", "friends", "helped", "line", "help", "havoc", "causing", "tackle", "james"], "summary": "They knew rookie left guard James Daniels would have to lead the way based on where Donald lines up.\nThe Rams star plays all over the defensive line, but the Bears were confident Daniels could hold his own against Donald, especially with some help.\nDaniels blocked Donald with help from center Cody Whitehair on 10 snaps.\nThat was about it for Donald highlights, though, as the Bears got four hands on him much of the time.\nbmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsBrad Biggs' 10 thoughts on the Bears' 15-6 win over the Rams \u00bbBears coach Matt Nagy apologizes to official for outburst after botched substitution: 'I told them that they did the right thing' \u00bbNBC's Cris Collinsworth on the Bears: 'I'm really impressed' \u00bb"}, {"link": "https://www.mmaweekly.com/tyron-woodley-insists-he-has-not-refused-to-headline-ufc-233", "published": "2018-12-10T23:14:38", "title": "Tyron Woodley Insists He Has Not Refused to Headline UFC 233", "author": ["Mmaweekly.Com Staff"], "text": "Tyron Woodley Insists He Has Not Refused to Headline UFC 233\n\nThe situation at the top of the UFC welterweight division is contentious, to put it mildly, but champion Tyron Woodley insists that he has not turned down an opportunity to headline UFC 233 on Jan. 26 in Anaheim, Calif., as has been insinuated.\n\nAll expectations were for Woodley to return from hand surgery to fight former interim champion Colby Covington in the next defense of his belt.

That is something he\u2019s not willing to risk.

Tennessee\u2019s lone loss was in overtime to the new No. 1 Kansas, so the Volunteers, who were seventh on my ballot last week, moved up to fourth this week. Kansas and Michigan should be a clear 1-2 with Duke, Tennessee and Gonzaga somewhere in the 3-4-5 slots. I go Duke, Tennessee and Gonzaga, but you could order them however you\u2019d like, but Tennessee is in college basketball\u2019s top tier for sure.\n\nTeam on the fall\n\n* Kansas State: The Wildcats had some preseason beef over where they were being predicted given they returned basically everybody from last year\u2019s Elite 8 team, but so far, not so good. After starting 6-0, Kansas State has dropped its last two games, to Marquette (a really good team) and Tulsa (a not-so-good team), which held the Wildcats to 46 points. That was enough for me drop them from No. 14 on my ballot last week to unranked this week.\n\nAbout the Wolf Pack\n\n* Nevada: Tennessee\u2019s win over Gonzaga pushed the Wolf Pack down a spot on my ballot, but it will be a good thing for Nevada in the long run. The Zags going undefeated was the biggest impediment to Nevada not getting to the top spot at some point later this year. That impediment is now gone, and the teams currently above Nevada will almost certainly lose in conference play, which should push the Pack up. It\u2019s hard to argue for Nevada above Kansas, Michigan, Duke, Tennessee and Gonzaga given their strength of schedules.

I'm surprised you're still asking.\"\n\nWhen he was first asked about Harper during a session with Yankees beat reporters on the first full day of this year's winter meetings, Cashman rattled off the names of his six current outfielders (Aaron Hicks, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Brett Gardner, Jacoby Ellsbury and Clint Frazier) as reasons he isn't looking for a seventh.\n\nWould the Yankees sign Harper -- who could command a total deal worth $300 million or more -- and get him to exchange his outfielder's glove for a first-base mitt?\n\n\"I'm sure it's potentially a possibility, but it's not something that we would play on at that level with that type of money, to play somebody like that at first base,\" Cashman said.\n\nAs weary as Cashman has grown of them, the questions about Harper being linked to the Yankees have persisted in earnest since New York was beaten by the eventual World Series champion Boston Red Sox back in October.\n\nA player whose longtime Yankees fandom has been well-documented, Harper's violent, left-handed swing seems to suit Yankee Stadium's short right-field dimensions.\n\nBut Cashman, speaking to Yankees reporters on that first day, indicated that signing Harper would not top his extensive to-do list between now and spring training. He reiterated that his primary focus since the end of the season has been bolstering New York's starting pitching and looking for ways to manage the loss of shortstop Didi Gregorius, who underwent Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm earlier this offseason.\n\nCashman said Monday that he still had no specific timeline for Gregorius' return, but he mentioned that it might not be until July or August.\n\nThe Yankees might be out in the Harper sweepstakes, but Gregorius' injury has them very much in the conversation for star free-agent infielder Manny Machado.\n\n\"We were definitely focused in the marketplace on those areas of need [shortstop], and he obviously is available and solves that area of need,\" Cashman said. \"So not going to deny we've had a conversation or two.\"\n\nCashman said he and Machado's agent, Dan Lozano, spoke before the winter meetings. Machado is reportedly planning to soon visit the teams that are courting him in free agency.\n\nIn terms of the hole the Yankees have in their starting rotation, free-agent J.A. Happ remains a serious option. The lefty was added at the trade deadline to bolster the flailing staff heading into the postseason. In 11 starts across the final two months of the regular season, Happ looked like the Yankees' ace, going 7-0 with a 2.69 ERA.\n\n\"We'll see if we all match up,\" Cashman said of talks he has had with Happ's representatives about a contract.\n\nThe focus on Happ has increased since the Yankees added James Paxton to the mix in a trade last month with Seattle and following Patrick Corbin's signing with the Washington Nationals last week.\n\nExpect the Yankees to also be involved in the race for Japanese pitcher Yusei Kikuchi, the 27-year-old who could be even better on the mound than Shohei Ohtani. Teams have until Jan. 2 to negotiate with the lefty, who had a 3.08 ERA and struck out 153 batters in 23 starts for the Seibu Lions of the Nippon Professional Baseball Organization this season.\n\n\"He's somebody worth talking about.

With three weeks left, it\u2019s far from guaranteed the Steelers will be one of the AFC\u2019s six playoff teams.\n\nFiguring out this Steelers season is hard. They started 1-2-1 and looked mediocre. Then for a month and a half, they looked like one of the best teams in football. When they blasted the Carolina Panthers 52-21 on Nov. 8, they looked like a legitimate Super Bowl contender.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s check in on the Steelers\u2019 four games since then \u2026\n\n\u2022 The Steelers spend three quarters sleepwalking against the Jaguars, and were bailed out by Jacksonville coach Doug Marrone going into a shell and letting Pittsburgh come back. It was a bad performance, but excusable because it ended in a win. They won on a Ben Roethlisberger run in the final seconds.\n\n\u2022 At Denver, the Steelers piled up a lot of yards but turnovers were their undoing. They out-gained the Broncos 527-308. A fluky interception by Roethlisberger to a nose tackle near the goal line ended it. A loss to the Broncos wasn\u2019t ideal, but close road losses in the NFL happen.\n\n\u2022 Pittsburgh blew a lead of more than 14 points at home for the first time in franchise history against the Chargers. The Steelers turned a 23-7 halftime advantage into a loss. The Chargers are a good team, at least.\n\n\u2022 The Steelers lost to the Oakland Raiders. Yeah, that happened.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s part of the Steelers\u2019 DNA under coach Mike Tomlin to go on the road against a bad team, especially on the West Coast, and have an inexplicable loss. Losing to a Raiders team that was 2-10 coming in takes that to an extreme. Roethlisberger missed some of the game with a rib injury, though he came back late. Why Roethlisberger was on the sideline for a while, then returned, got really confusing afterward. Tomlin said he was able to go back in when he got back to the sideline.\n\n\u201cHe probably could\u2019ve come in a series or so sooner, but we were in a rhythm and flow of the game,\u201d Tomlin said, via PennLive.com.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsensical. It might have cost the Steelers a game they couldn\u2019t afford to lose against one of the worst teams in football.\n\nThe Steelers are lucky the Chiefs rallied to beat the Ravens, or they\u2019d have been in second place of the AFC North. As is, the Steelers\u2019 half-game lead over the Ravens is tenuous. They\u2019ve looked shaky for four weeks and face the Patriots at home and then travel to face the Saints the next two weeks. Even a 1-1 record in those games could cost them the division. If they go 0-2 \u2014 and considering the Patriots and Saints are a combined 20-6, that\u2019s possible \u2014 they\u2019ll be 7-7-1 going into Week 17 and could be in a tough battle for the final wild-card spot in the AFC. Nobody expected that a month ago.\n\nWhat happened? Some of it is simply bad luck. They lost James Conner to an injury late against the Chargers and had no running game against Oakland (40 yards rushing, and 15 of that came from backup quarterback Joshua Dobbs). If Conner misses more games, and it sounds like he will, the running game won\u2019t get much better. Yes, the Le\u2019Veon Bell year-long holdout still lingers. Having Roethlisberger miss some key series cost the Steelers in the end, though a weird coaching decision to keep holding Roethlisberger out because of the \u201crhythm and flow of the game\u201d seems to have contributed to that. The Steelers could have tied the Raiders at the end but kicker Chris Boswell slipped on the turf trying a game-tying field goal. Losing to the Raiders is inexcusable no matter any unfortunate luck, but it\u2019s not the only bad beat in the streak.\n\nThe loss against the Broncos was fluky; Pittsburgh was the better team most of the game. The Chargers got some breaks too, especially a couple from the officials. There\u2019s not an enormous difference between the best and worst teams in the NFL, and a few bad breaks here and there can turn around things in a hurry. Just a play or two in each game turns out differently, and the Steelers might be 10-2-1 instead. That\u2019s life in the NFL.\n\nIf there\u2019s a tangible reason for the slump, it\u2019s the defense. When the Steelers got hot, the defense didn\u2019t allow 300 yards for five straight games. They\u2019ve allowed at least 300 in each loss during their three-game skid, including to the bad offenses of Denver and Oakland.\n\nWhether it\u2019s an organizational breakdown or simply the tide of luck turning, the Steelers suddenly find themselves in a difficult spot. They play two of the best teams in the NFL in Weeks 15 and 16, and if they can\u2019t win one of them, they might miss the playoffs. If the Steelers go 1-2, Ravens win a couple games and a 7-6 team like the Colts or Titans wins two of three, the Steelers would be out. That\u2019s not a crazy scenario.\n\nOne can only imagine the outrage in Pittsburgh if the Steelers go from 7-2-1 to out of the playoffs. The NFL changes fast sometimes.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (19) couldn\u2019t haul in this deep pass in a loss to the Raiders. (AP)\n\nHere are the power rankings after Week 14 of the NFL season:\n\n32. Arizona Cardinals (3-10, Last Week: 30)\n\nAfter watching them throw out an absolute dud at home against the Lions, one question lingers: How in the world did this team win at Lambeau Field?\n\n31. Oakland Raiders (3-10, LW: 32)\n\nWith Reggie McKenzie fired, the Raiders\u2019 next general manager hire is a crucial one. Jon Gruden will still have the power, but he needs a strong personnel man that he respects to guide him into a better offseason than he had in 2018. It\u2019s especially important with five first-round picks in the next two years. If the new GM is brought in to smile and tell Gruden that it\u2019s a great idea to keep stockpiling free agents in their 30s, this probably isn\u2019t going to turn around very soon.\n\n30. San Francisco 49ers (3-10, LW: 31)\n\nGeorge Kittle had 210 yards at halftime, four yards short of Shannon Sharpe\u2019s single-game NFL record for a tight end. He was held without a catch in the second half. The 49ers couldn\u2019t get him one catch after halftime to get the record?\n\n29. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-9, LW: 27)\n\nWatching the Jaguars barely try to tackle Derrick Henry, combined with the Colts winning at the Texans on Sunday \u2026 Jacksonville shutting out Indianapolis in Week 13 is just baffling.\n\n28. Cincinnati Bengals (5-8, LW: 28)\n\nIt will be lost in the shuffle because the Chargers won and nobody was focused on that game, but the Bengals taking the Chargers to the brink on the road was an impressive effort for a team that has nothing to play for. The Bengals were playing one of the NFL\u2019s best teams, on the road, without A.J. Green and with Jeff Driskel at quarterback. Nobody expected them to be trying a two-point conversion for the tie at the end.\n\n27. Atlanta Falcons (4-9, LW: 23)\n\nIs there another team that wants the season to end more than the Falcons? Being down 34-7 at Green Bay through three quarters says all you need to know.\n\n26. Washington Redskins (6-7, LW: 22)\n\nNot only were the Redskins down 40-0 to the Giants, it was a Giants team without Odell Beckham. The good news is this week the Redskins get to face the Jaguars, who might be the least motivated team in the NFL (other than that one strange time against the Colts in Week 13 when they tried).\n\n25. Buffalo Bills (4-9, LW: 25)\n\nJosh Allen has 99, 135 and 101 yards rushing the past three games. Allen, in just nine games, leads the Bills in rushing. With LeSean McCoy\u2019s hamstring hurting, Allen might finish the season as the team\u2019s leading rusher too. Allen was a good runner at Wyoming but not great (767 yards in 27 games), so despite his athleticism, his ability to make plays with his legs has been pretty shocking.\n\n24. New York Jets (4-9, LW: 29)\n\nMaybe it matters, maybe it doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a positive for Todd Bowles to avenge the worst loss of the Jets\u2019 season. The Jets were absolutely awful in a loss to the Bills a few weeks ago, but they pulled out a close win on Sunday.\n\n23. Detroit Lions (5-8, LW: 24)\n\nThe Lions won, but they had 218 yards on offense. Injuries have really hurt, but it\u2019s surprising how bad Detroit\u2019s offense has slipped. Nobody is speaking glowingly anymore about the future of offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter.\n\n22. New York Giants (5-8, LW: 26)\n\nOdell Beckham practiced on Wednesday and Thursday before showing up on Friday\u2019s injury report as limited, then was ruled out Saturday with a bruised quad \u2026 it just seems a little off. Or maybe it\u2019s totally normal and it seems off because it\u2019s Beckham, and everything with Beckham becomes a bigger story than it should be.\n\n21. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-8, LW: 21)\n\nGetting outscored 25-0 in the second half against the Saints wasn\u2019t the best look. For the first half it looked like the Buccaneers were emerging as that \u201cteam that plays really well after their playoff hopes are dead\u201d squad for this season.\n\n20. Green Bay Packers (5-7-1, LW: 19)\n\nFair or not, if the Packers go on a tear to end the season, wouldn\u2019t you have to hold that against Mike McCarthy if you\u2019re another team interviewing him for a head-coaching vacancy?\n\n19. Denver Broncos (6-7, LW: 17)\n\nBefore Sunday, it wasn\u2019t crazy to start considering the Broncos a possible wild-card contender. Then they lost to a 49ers team that was 2-10. It\u2019s not quite as bad as the Steelers\u2019 loss to Oakland on Sunday, but pretty close.\n\n18. Carolina Panthers (6-7, LW: 16)\n\nThe Panthers have had no luck in close games. Of their seven losses, six have come by a touchdown or less. In each of those games, they either led or had the ball in the final two minutes with a chance to tie or take the lead. If they could have pulled off even two of those six games \u2014 scoring from the 3-yard line against the Browns, getting a two-point conversion against the Lions, or finishing late drives in opposing territory against the Redskins, Falcons or Buccaneers \u2014 they\u2019d be a great bet to make the playoffs. That\u2019s how thin the margins are in the NFL.\n\n17. Philadelphia Eagles (6-7, LW: 13)\n\nIt was a little surprising that Doug Pederson, whose calling card last season was being aggressive, didn\u2019t go for a two-point conversion after the Eagles scored with 1:45 left. He kicked the extra point and played for overtime. It wouldn\u2019t have been a bad call to go for the win there, given that the Eagles were underdogs on the road. \u201cI felt at the time that we were still going to win that football game,\u201d Pederson explained, via WIP 94. \u201cAnd our defense was gaining momentum, we were beginning to put pressure on Dak [Prescott], and doing some things that way.\u201d Instead, the Eagles tied the game, lost in overtime, and their season is on life support.\n\n16. Minnesota Vikings (6-6-1, LW: 12)\n\nKirk Cousins didn\u2019t do much in another big game. That has been an issue all season. Another issue is that offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, who was such a hot name last offseason, hasn\u2019t been nearly as good as last year\u2019s coordinator Pat Shurmur. Whoever is to blame, this is a huge disappointment.\n\n15. Cleveland Browns (5-7-1, LW: 20)\n\nI\u2019ll let Tony Grossi of ESPNCleveland.com handle the crazy scenario for the Browns can make the playoffs. I mean, it\u2019s improbable but not impossible \u2026\n\nBrowns make AFC playoffs if win all three for 8-7-1 and: Miami loses 2 of 3 (Min, Jax, Buf). Baltimore loses 2 of 3 (TB, Chargers, Cle). Tennessee loses 2 of 3 (NYG, Wash, Indy). Indianapolis loses 2 of 3 (Dal, NYG, Tenn). Denver loses 1 of 3 (Cle, Raiders, Chargers) \u2014 Tony Grossi (@TonyGrossi) December 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Miami Dolphins (7-6, LW: 18)\n\nThis is where I\u2019ll point out that, yeah, the Kenyan Drake touchdown was awesome, and before that play he had six touches. Six. There aren\u2019t many coaching decisions that have been stranger this season than the Dolphins simply refusing to give Drake a bigger part of the offense, no matter how well he plays.\n\n13. Indianapolis Colts (7-6, LW: 15)\n\nEric Ebron has 13 touchdowns. The single-season record for a tight end is 17 by Rob Gronkowski. Ebron might not get the record but the fact it\u2019s even a realistic conversation means this was a great value signing by the Colts (and we have to ask how the Lions never got much of anything out of Ebron).\n\n12. Tennessee Titans (7-6, LW: 14)\n\nIt\u2019s not like Derrick Henry didn\u2019t have a chance to carve out a bigger role. Early in the season he had two games with 18 carries, and did little with it. Through four games, he was averaging just three yards per carry. Then he got his playing time scaled back. If Thursday night\u2019s 238-yard explosion happens in that first month, maybe it\u2019s an entirely different season for Henry.\n\n11. Baltimore Ravens (7-6, LW: 11)\n\nThe most damaging loss on Sunday might have been by the Ravens. Had they gotten a stop on either fourth down on the Chiefs last drive, or put together a game-winning drive at the end of regulation or overtime, they\u2019d be the AFC North favorite right now. The Steelers shockingly lost to the Raiders, and still have games left against the Patriots and Saints. The Ravens can still steal the division but a huge win over the Chiefs would have been a big help.\n\n10. Seattle Seahawks (8-5, LW: 10)\n\nNot only are the Seahawks looking good for a wild-card spot, they\u2019ll likely be the top wild-card team in the NFC. There are a lot of great candidates for coach of the year, but Pete Carroll needs to be mentioned too.\n\n9. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-5-1, LW: 8)\n\nAntonio Brown is one of the best receivers of his era, a likely Hall of Famer. Yet this season, JuJu Smith-Schuster has more catches (91 to 86) and more yards too (1,234 to 1,063). Smith-Schuster was a grand slam draft pick by the Steelers in the late second round last year.\n\n8. Dallas Cowboys (8-5, LW: 9)\n\nAmari Cooper was the star, but Dak Prescott\u2019s 455 yards against the Eagles was impressive too. He gave Cooper a chance to get two long touchdowns in the fourth quarter with some nice throws. He was great in an overtime drive. If Prescott plays like that (without the two interceptions he threw) that obviously raises Dallas\u2019 ceiling.\n\n7. Houston Texans (9-4, LW: 6)\n\nA win would have been better, but a loss Sunday didn\u2019t really hurt the Texans too much. They still have a two-game lead in the division and are still in the mix for a first-round bye thanks to the Patriots\u2019 crazy loss. The Texans\u2019 final three games are against the Jets, Eagles and Jaguars, and it\u2019s easy to see them winning out. That puts a lot of pressure on the Patriots to win out as well.\n\n6. New England Patriots (9-4, LW: 4)\n\nNext week\u2019s game at Pittsburgh is a big one in terms of securing a first-round bye. Lose that and the door is open for the Texans to get the second seed. Considering the Patriots are 3-4 on the road, it\u2019s no sure thing they win at Pittsburgh, or away from Foxborough in January either. Giving up that Kenyan Drake touchdown might haunt them for a while.\n\n5. Chicago Bears (9-4, LW: 7)\n\nMaybe the result would be different if the teams meet in Los Angeles in January, but the Bears domination of the Rams offense was so thorough, you have to wonder if Chicago just matches up with the Rams really well. There\u2019s no way Los Angeles wants to see the Bears defense again in the playoffs.\n\n4. Los Angeles Chargers (10-3, LW: 5)\n\nSunday was a tough spot for the Chargers, coming off a huge road win over the Steelers with a massive AFC West game against the Chiefs coming on Thursday. You don\u2019t want to have to stop a two-point conversion to avoid going to overtime at home against the Bengals, but it\u2019s somewhat explainable. Now they get their shot on Thursday night to keep the AFC West race interesting.\n\n3. Kansas City Chiefs (11-2, LW: 3)\n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say about Patrick Mahomes anymore. His 48-yard pass to Tyreek Hill on fourth down to keep the Chiefs alive on Sunday was as good as you\u2019ll ever see. If he wins MVP, that throw will be one of the main reasons.\n\n2. Los Angeles Rams (11-2, LW: 1)\n\nThe difference between the top three teams is slight. You can make a strong argument for the Saints, Rams or Chiefs in the top spot. All of them had some bad moments on Sunday. Again, that happens in the NFL. Even though it\u2019s clear they\u2019re the top three teams, everyone is beatable. We saw that with the Bears beatdown of the Rams on Sunday night. The playoffs might get really crazy this season.\n\n1. New Orleans Saints (11-2, LW: 2)\n\nIt was hard to move the Saints back to the No. 1 spot considering how badly they struggled for six quarters against the Cowboys and Buccaneers. But they came alive in the second half at Tampa, they have a win over the Rams and they still seem like the most complete of the three teams vying for the top spot. Next Monday night at Carolina is a huge game for them. They finish with two home games, against the Steelers and Panthers. Those two teams are capable, but the Saints are great at home. And three more wins means they\u2019d have home-field advantage through the NFC playoffs.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

However, Darnold's composure in leading the team downfield for the late game-winning score in Sunday's 27-23 win over the Buffalo Bills was exactly the kind of thing the Jets and their fans had been hoping to see from him this year.\n\nLet's look at some specific examples before we draw conclusions:\n\n3rd quarter, 8.18. Jets trailing 20-13. third-and-9 at the Bills 33\n\nAfter a first half which saw Darnold throw just six passes, the Jets continued to be conservative at the start of the second half, but moved into field goal range on their opening drive with Darnold completing three short passes. However, faced with a third-and-9, Darnold made a poor decision on the move and was intercepted by Tremaine Edmunds.\n\nThe Jets were operating out of an empty set on the play but Darnold was immediately flushed from the pocket as both tackles were beaten on the play. That was a rare breakdown in pass protection from a unit that didn't give up a sack or quarterback hit all day. As he rolled right, Darnold signalled to his receiver to get open down the field but then committed the cardinal sin of throwing back across his body.\n\nChris Herndon had uncovered momentarily, but Darnold forced the throw and the pass was picked off. Although he leads the league in interceptions, Darnold has been avoiding mistakes as egregious as that one, so this should serve as a reminder of the importance of looking after the football.\n\n4th quarter, 12:17. Jets trailing 20-13. third-and-5 at the Bills 7\n\nDarnold bounced back immediately from his mistake by authoring an 85-yard drive on the next possession. This culminated in perhaps his signature play of the season so far. Once again, the Jets were operating out of a five-wide formation and this time the pocket collapsed with Kyle Williams stunting around the left side to flush Darnold from the pocket. Having eluded Williams, Darnold reversed his field and rolled back to the left, kept his eyes up and fired a strike to Robby Anderson on the move.\n\nThis is the kind of play that demonstrates Darnold's elite potential. The throw alone, moving to his left, was special, but his athleticism to avoid the rush, composure to reset himself as he reversed course back toward the line of scrimmage and his vision to anticipate Anderson uncovering in the end zone showcase his elite tools.\n\nDespite making the earlier mistake on the interception, it was encouraging to see Darnold make an anticipatory throw on the move this time.\n\n4th quarter, 1:54. Jets trailing 23-20. second-and-4 at the Bills 42\n\nThis was the key play of the game as Darnold's pinpoint deep pass to Anderson set the Jets up at the 5-yard line, moving them into range for at least the tying field goal or -- as it transpired -- the game-winning touchdown.\n\nHaving moved the Jets to the fringes of field range, Darnold exploited a defense that was playing to prevent any short gains by dropping a deep ball right in over Anderson's shoulder. Darnold launched the deep ball after having faked a hand-off to the back in a four-wide formation.\n\nRather than an anticipatory throw, this was more a case of throwing it to a spot and trusting his receiver to go and get it. This is also a good sign, especially if Anderson returns to the team next year and continues to build his chemistry with Darnold.\n\nConclusions\n\nAfter another conservative start, offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates allowed Darnold to air it out a bit more in the second half and, although he ended up with modest numbers, Darnold made enough big plays to lead the come-from-behind win.\n\nDarnold completed 16 of 24 passes for his third-highest completion percentage of the season. In fact, this was only the second time he had completed over 60 percent of his passes since Week 2. It's unlikely he's going to have any games where he puts up big numbers with the Jets' offense having struggled for most of the season. However, while he only ended up with 170 passing yards, a respectable 129 of those came after halftime.\n\nIt should also be noted that Darnold achieved this against one of the league's better defenses. The Bills entered Sunday's action as the No. 1 pass defense.

A lot of people helped me along the way, my teammates, my coaches, my family supporting me.\n\n\u201cI want to break it, so let\u2019s talk after I break it.\u201d\n\nIngram will try to break the record next week when the Saints play the Carolina Panthers on Monday night in Charlotte. He has seven career rushing touchdowns in 13 meetings against the Panthers.\n\nThe touchdown record isn\u2019t the only thing on Ingram\u2019s mind. He wants to break McAllister\u2019s rushing yardage record, too, and after running for 52 yards Sunday, Ingram is 215 yards shy of McAllister\u2019s franchise record of 6,096 rushing yards.\n\nThe Saints have three games left this season for Ingram to gain 216 yards and score one more touchdown to claim those two records. After that, Ingram is set to become an unrestricted free agent, so there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll have more opportunities to add to his statistics with the Saints.\n\nWhatever happens, though, Ingram has impressively established himself as one of the best running backs in Saints history. The 2011 first-round pick had a lackluster and injury-plagued start to his career, but he\u2019s now averaging 4.5 yards per carry in his career and, along with Alvin Kamara, has given the Saints offense balance the past two seasons.\n\nCoach Sean Payton praised Ingram for running with confidence, good pad level and for staying healthy the past few years.\n\n\u201cI thought the run yesterday was impressive, and he\u2019s been real consistent,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good company when you look at what Deuce accomplished.\u201d", "keywords": ["ingram", "dragging", "way", "tie", "running", "rushing", "saints", "record", "yards", "career", "mcallisters", "deuce", "fitting", "break", "thats", "touchdown", "td", "mark"], "summary": "Mark Ingram thought his physical 17-yard touchdown run against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was a fitting way for him to etch his name in the New Orleans Saints record book.\nHe has seven career rushing touchdowns in 13 meetings against the Panthers.\nThe touchdown record isn\u2019t the only thing on Ingram\u2019s mind.\nHe wants to break McAllister\u2019s rushing yardage record, too, and after running for 52 yards Sunday, Ingram is 215 yards shy of McAllister\u2019s franchise record of 6,096 rushing yards.\nCoach Sean Payton praised Ingram for running with confidence, good pad level and for staying healthy the past few years."}, {"link": "https://www.fieldgulls.com/2018/12/10/18135601/seattle-seahawks-playoff-clinch-wild-card-week-15-eagles-redskins-panthers-vikings-49ers", "published": "2018-12-11T04:58:06", "title": "Seahawks with a chance to clinch a Wild Card berth in Week 15", "author": ["Dec"], "text": "On Monday Night Football the Seattle Seahawks hosted the Minnesota Vikings, with the winner of the game set to take over the top Wild Card spot in the NFC playoff race. The two teams entered the contest within a game of each other, but with their 21-7 victory the Seahawks have put a stranglehold on the five seed in the playoff race.\n\nThe Hawks currently sit at 8-5, a game and a half up on the 6-6-1 Vikings in the sixth and final playoff spot. Thus, while there are technically multiple teams that could catch up to Seattle, realistically the Hawks have all but assured themselves of a playoff spot. There are three teams that could win out and finish with eight wins, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the New York Giants and the Detroit Lions, and a fourth team - the Green Bay Packers - which could max out at 8.5 wins. Thus, a single win down the stretch eliminates the possibility of any of these four catching up to the Seahawks. As the Seattle schedule over the final three games of the season includes two games against two of the three worst teams in the entire NFL, it seems like it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to officially knock these teams out.\n\nThen there are four teams which currently have six wins. These include the Minnesota Vikings, the Carolina Panthers, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins. The Panthers, Eagles and Redskins would finish at 9-7 if they win out, meaning Seattle needs a combination of one win of their own and one loss from each of these three teams over the final three weeks of the season in order to clinch a playoff berth.\n\nThus, it is possible that Seattle could be able to clinch a playoff berth as early as Week 15. The matchups those three teams face in Week 15 are formidable, and hopefully the Seahawks can take care of business on a short trip down to the Bay Area. If the Hawks defeat the San Francisco 49ers next Sunday, and the following three things happen:\n\nWashington loses to the Jacksonville Jaguars,\n\nPhiladelphia loses to the Los Angeles Rams and\n\nCarolina loses to the New Orleans Saints,\n\nthe the Hawks would have 9 wins, with only six NFC teams capable of reaching the 9 win threshold.

Afterward, head coach Andy Reid and many of the players spoke with the press, and we have some key takeaways from what they said:\n\nAndy Reid led off \u2014 as always \u2014 with what he knew about injuries to Chiefs players.\n\n\u201cAs far as the injuries go, Cam Erving hurt his right knee and had to come out of the game, and then Spencer Ware tweaked his hamstring a little bit,\u201d said Reid in his opening remarks. \u201cWe will just have to see how both of those go.\u201d\n\nWare was believed to have injured his shoulder in the second quarter of the game when the Ravens\u2019 Eric Weddle knocked him hard to the ground after a 31-yard catch-and-run along the sideline. After receiving attention, Ware returned to the game and made some good plays \u2014 which could lead us to believe that the hamstring injury was from a second incident that occurred later. (Ware had a touch in the Chiefs\u2019 last series during regulation, but did not have one during overtime). That will surely be something Reid will be asked about when he speaks to the press on Monday.\n\nWe already knew about a Chiefs player that was injured twice in the game \u2014 wide receiver Tyreek Hill \u2014 as Reid confirmed.\n\n\u201cHe hurt his hand,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThen he hurt his foot. You know \u2014 it was a couple of things. He got stepped on, and then he got his hand in between two helmets. He was okay when it was all said and done.\u201d\n\nReid said that Hill was the one who said he was OK.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he told me,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI believed him, and he [went] in there and did a good job. He loves to play \u2014 that little joker.\u201d\n\nReid and his players spoke at length about the resilience of the Chiefs team in their overtime win.\n\n\u201cThe highs and lows \u2014 [the] ebb and flow of the game \u2014 no one was hanging their head,\u201d said the head coach. \u201cEveryone came out and remained positive and kept themselves in attack mode on both sides of the ball and special teams. Harrison Butker ended up being the hero. Everyone was looking at him like, \u2018Ah, he missed two kicks,\u2019 and then he comes back and he\u2019s the man. But there\u2019s a lesson there. I saw our players go up to him and tell him to just hang in there \u2014 we are going to need you again. And we did. That\u2019s this football team.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the improvised fourth-and-9 pass from Patrick Mahomes to Tyreek Hill, Chiefs center Mitch Morse agreed.\n\n\u201cI think it was just resilience,\u201d Morse said. \u201cThat was kind of the key component the whole day. Guys made plays in big possessions and big times in the game. It was such a big play by both those guys. It was fun to be a part of. It changed the momentum of the game.\u201d\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce had a similar view.\n\n\u201cFour minutes left. We\u2019re down at least seven,\u201d Kelce said. \u201c[Then on] fourth down, finding a way to not only put seven on the board but get a strip-sack late. This team just keeps fighting. I think that\u2019s a testament to each other. It\u2019s endless.\u201d\n\nMahomes said it was the best kind of win.\n\n\u201cThese are the best wins,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have to battle and you trade blows with somebody \u2014 a great football team, a physical football team [that] has a lot of talent. So when you trade blows with a team like that and come out with a win in the end, those are the wins that you remember. Those are the wins that satisfy you the most.\u201d\n\nFor Reid, the resilience of the team begins with his young signal-caller.\n\nReid said that Sunday was Mahomes\u2019 best game as a Chief.\n\n\u201cHe really did a nice job,\u201d said Reid. \u201cThis defense was a huge, huge challenge. These son of a guns were really good, and had a really good package. They unloaded it at [the offense] and [Mahomes] kept bringing it. I am proud of him for doing that. You can get a little defeated if you get sacked or hit as many times as he got hit, but he stayed right in there and kept firing. I am proud of him for that.\u201d\n\nReid said that Mahomes\u2019 interception in the third quarter \u2014 ending a drive that started with good field position, and could easily have given the Chiefs a commanding lead \u2014 didn\u2019t affect him.\n\n\u201cPeople would hang their head on an interception like that, or just being hit,\u201d Reid said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do that. He tries to fix the problem, which is unique, I mean... he just wants to get it fixed. He will tell me to dial it up again. This is after he gets hit on the play. I will take care of it, so it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different that way. I appreciate that. He is a unique kid.\u201d\n\nOf course, Mahomes was asked about the insane fourth-and-9 play that set up the tying touchdown at the end of regulation, where he was chased to the right sideline, and then threw across his body to hit Hill on the left hash mark \u2014 a play that gained 48 yards.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be a pass to the left so Tyreek was kind of clearing out,\u201d Mahomes explained. \u201cWhen I scrambled to the right, I knew I didn\u2019t have a lot of guys back there. Luckily, he just kind of worked back to me and I saw him. When it\u2019s fourth down, you\u2019ve got to give it a chance, so I just put it out there. He came back to the ball in front of \u2014 I think Weddle \u2014 and then made a great catch.\u201d\n\nReid said that Hill is a special player, too.\n\n\u201cThis kid never complains about anything, and he practices hard every day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe loves to play the game, and that\u2019s what you got today. He was banged up a little bit. He worked his way through it, came back and made some big plays for us. You love his attitude. He is another one that is unique.\u201d\n\nReid said that against the Ravens \u2014 and for the final three games of the season \u2014 the Chiefs are getting every team\u2019s best effort.\n\n\u201cWhen you are a good football team, every week ends up being the playoffs,\u201d Reid said. \u201cEvery game, you are going to get the team\u2019s best shot. This is a good football team that John Harbaugh has here \u2014 a really good football team. We got their best shot right there, and that\u2019s not going to be any different than next week and as the season finishes up here. We have to be ready. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s four days of rest or two days. It doesn\u2019t matter where we play or anywhere else. We have to be ready.\u201d\n\nReid said that the Los Angeles Chargers game on Thursday will be a tough challenge.\n\n\u201cWe have to be on our A-game,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a good football team coming in here. When you are in the month of December, you are still in contention and every week becomes important.\u201d\n\nOther notable quotes from Sunday:\n\nChris Jones on Justin Houston\u2019s strip-sack with less than a minute in regulation: \u201cI told y\u2019all,\u201c he reminded reporters around him. \u201cDon\u2019t let Justin Houston sneak up on y\u2019all, man. He is still a dynamic pass rusher. This guy can go out and have three or four sacks in a game. Just the spectacle of Justin Houston. Just him being him.\u201d\n\nHouston himself was asked about the play: \u201cI just knew that we had to make a play. Justin Hamilton walked up to me on the sideline, and he called me out. He said, \u2018You showed energy all week long, I need it now. You are the leader of this defense. I need it now.\u2019 So he challenged me, and I wanted to be that guy that the team could lean on in a time of need.\u201d\n\nMitch Morse wanted to be sure to give props to fellow offensive lineman Eric Fisher for recovering Mahomes\u2019 fumble in overtime: \u201cTalk about a huge play in the game. That is just the kind of guy he is. He\u2019s finishing around the ball. He has worked on that in practice. In a big moment like that, that [was] the play we [needed], and he [was] able to pull it out.\u201d", "keywords": ["football", "postgame", "fourthand9", "press", "mahomes", "right", "injuries", "chiefs", "roundup", "play", "reid", "best", "team", "game", "resilience", "good"], "summary": "He loves to play \u2014 that little joker.\u201dReid and his players spoke at length about the resilience of the Chiefs team in their overtime win.\n\u201cWhen you have to battle and you trade blows with somebody \u2014 a great football team, a physical football team [that] has a lot of talent.\n\u201cWhen you are a good football team, every week ends up being the playoffs,\u201d Reid said.\nThis is a good football team that John Harbaugh has here \u2014 a really good football team.\n\u201cThis is a good football team coming in here."}, {"link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzBW7SxJe4", "published": "2018-12-09T23:40:49", "title": "Kyler Murray 'speechless' after winning Heisman Trophy | College Football 2018", "author": [], "text": "Published on Dec 9, 2018\n\nKyler Murray joins Chris Fowler after winning the Heisman Trophy to talk about his journey and the Oklahoma Sooners being the first school to have quarterbacks win back-to-back Heisman's.\n\n\n\n\u2714 Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE\n\n\u2714 Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC\n\n\u2714 Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN\n\n\u2714 Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTV\n\n\n\nESPN on Social Media:\n\n\u25ba Follow on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/espn\n\n\u25ba Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/espn\n\n\u25ba Follow on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/espn\n\n\n\nVisit ESPN on YouTube to get up-to-the-minute sports news coverage, scores, highlights and commentary for NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, College Football, NCAA Basketball, soccer and more.\n\n\n\nMore on ESPN.com: http://www.espn.com", "keywords": ["trophy", "football", "nba", "winning", "youtube", "murray", "kyler", "win", "uptotheminute", "watch", "college", "speechless", "espn", "subscribe", "follow", "twitter", "2018", "heisman"], "summary": "Published on Dec 9, 2018Kyler Murray joins Chris Fowler after winning the Heisman Trophy to talk about his journey and the Oklahoma Sooners being the first school to have quarterbacks win back-to-back Heisman's.\n\u2714 Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE\u2714 Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC\u2714 Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN\u2714 Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTVESPN on Social Media:\u25ba Follow on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/espn\u25ba Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/espn\u25ba Follow on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/espnVisit ESPN on YouTube to get up-to-the-minute sports news coverage, scores, highlights and commentary for NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, College Football, NCAA Basketball, soccer and more.\nMore on ESPN.com: http://www.espn.com"}, {"link": "https://www.federalbaseball.com/2018/12/10/18134749/mlb-winter-meetings-2018-washington-nationals-looking-at-second-basemen", "published": "2018-12-10T20:09:13", "title": "MLB Winter Meetings 2018: Washington Nationals looking at second basemen out in Las Vegas....", "author": ["Dec"], "text": "Both GM Mike Rizzo and Washington Nationals\u2019 manager Davey Martinez are on the record stating that they\u2019re comfortable with the options at second base in the organization.\n\nRizzo, in an interview at Winterfest earlier this month, reiterated what he\u2019s said all winter.\n\nWith Howie Kendrick, Wilmer Difo, Carter Kieboom, and Luis Garcia, there\u2019s enough depth to go into the season without adding anyone to the mix.\n\n\u201cWe feel good with where we\u2019re at with second base,\u201d Rizzo explained. \u201cDifo is a terrific defender at second base and at shortstop, which is very, very valuable. Howie is a terrific second baseman. We\u2019ve just got to see how he comes back from the achilles [injury]. We know he\u2019s an elite hitter in the batter\u2019s box, and we\u2019ll see how he moves around at second base, but we\u2019ve got two studs in the minor leagues that are extremely capable of playing both middle infield positions and I think it\u2019s important to have that depth there.\u201d\n\nMartinez too said he was okay with the idea of a Kendrick/Difo platoon provided Kendrick is healthy.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m good with it,\u201d Martinez told reporters two weeks back. \u201cHowie looks great. He\u2019s walking perfectly, he said he can run right now if he needed to, and he\u2019s going to start hitting with [Hitting Coach Kevin Long], so he said when it comes to Spring Training he\u2019s fully going to be ready to play. So I\u2019m looking forward to getting [Kendrick] out there again, because we missed him. When he got hurt, good/bad, we got to see [Juan] Soto, but we missed Howie. He\u2019s a big part of our lineup, so we hope that we get him back and he\u2019s fully healthy.\u201d\n\nIn spite of those public statements, however, the rumors persist. Boston Globe writer Nick Cafardo, among others, wrote this weekend that the Nationals were going into the Winter Meetings potentially looking for a reliever and second baseman after having added some depth to the back end of the bullpen (with both Kyle Barraclough and Trevor Rosenthal), bolstered their catching corps (with both Kurt Suzuki and Yan Gomes), and upgraded their rotation (with a big deal for Patrick Corbin - 6-year/$140M deal).\n\n\u201cWill their remaining resources go toward a second baseman or an elite reliever? Not sure they\u2019ll be all-in with someone such as [Craig] Kimbrel, but more on the [Zach] Britton, [Andrew] Miller, and Adam Ottavino level. And at second base, could it be Brian Dozier, DJ LeMahieu, or even a reunion with Daniel Murphy?\u201d\n\nFancred\u2019s Jon Heyman wrote this afternoon, on Day 1 of the 2018 MLB Winter Meetings, that the Nationals were kicking the tires on some right side infielders...\n\nNats are looking closely at 2B. LeMahieu, Marwin, Harrison all in play. \u2014 Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) December 10, 2018\n\nOn potential moves this week: Rizzo has said Nats made contact with DJ LeMahieu\u2019s agent.

On Sunday, they barely missed their first shutout in 22 years when they allowed a lone fourth-quarter field goal in a 17-3 win over the Arizona Cardinals, and their run defense has surged to one of the best in the league.\n\nCardinals running back David Johnson is tackled by Lions linebacker Jarrad Davis.

I would expect that he'll be day-to-day.\"\n\nHayward, meanwhile, is out with an illness -- not anything to do with his recovery from the gruesome leg and ankle injuries he suffered six minutes into last year's season opener that caused him to miss the remainder of the 2017-18 campaign.\n\nPerhaps most concerning is the absence of Horford, who has missed four of Boston's past eight games due to an ongoing bout with patellar tendinitis in his left knee.\n\nHorford previously sat out one game and then came back before sitting out Saturday's win in Chicago and now Monday's game. Stevens indicated that this stint on the sideline might be longer to allow Horford to get completely over the tendinitis.\n\n\"Al has patellar tendinitis that he's just been dealing with for a while,\" Stevens said. \"And so we're going to see how this goes. He's day-to-day right now, but we may go slowly with him.\"\n\nHorford said before the game that it was difficult for him to sit out, but hopefully sitting out for a couple of games will prevent his knee issue from being a recurring problem.\n\n\"I don't want to have to keep dealing with this as a question mark game after game,\" he said. \"I just have to listen to the training staff and what the doctors are telling me and buy into that plan.\n\n\"I went out there and moved a little bit. Still not where I need to be -- right away I could tell. But it is much better than two days ago. Hopefully a couple more days, and we can put it behind me.\"\n\nIn addition to Boston's three stars sitting out, the Celtics were without center Aron Baynes and forward Guerschon Yabusele against the Pelicans, as both are dealing with ankle sprains. Baynes, like Irving, suffered his injury against the Knicks, but unlike Irving, he didn't play against Chicago. Stevens said Baynes had gotten better but not good enough to play.\n\nYabusele, meanwhile, suffered a nasty-looking right ankle sprain in Chicago, and Stevens said it will be weeks before the second-year forward will be ready to return.\n\n\"Not even close to playing,\" Stevens said. \"[It's] not a high ankle sprain, which is good news. The window is going to be at least a few weeks.\"\n\nWith all the absences, the Celtics started Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Morris and Daniel Theis against the Pelicans and activated PJ Dozier, who is on a two-way contract, to give the team added depth.\n\n\"I think we already know a lot about the guys, some of the guys that are going to have to step up for us -- they've done that before,\" Stevens said. \"But it'll be good to learn about some of the guys that haven't been in this situation.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for all those guys.

With the Dolphins sitting at their own 31-yard line, the Patriots coach put in his Hail Mary defense even though a Hail Mary would have been nearly impossible at that point. Ryan Tannehill would have had to throw a ball nearly 75 yards, which just wasn't going to happen because it was a wet day, he only had one good ankle (due to an injury earlier in the game), and let's not forget, this is a guy who missed seven weeks with a shoulder injury.\n\nThe problem with having your Hail Mary defense on the field is that you just don't match up with they other team. The Patriots defense included Rob Gronkowski as the last line of defense, and although he's a fantastic tight end, he's not the guy you want on the field trying to tackle a speedy running back or wide receiver, two of the positions that will almost always be touching the ball in a game-ending situation. Belichick out-thought himself and it cost his team the game.\n\nIf you watch the Dolphins' miracle play, you'll notice that they almost went UNTOUCHED as they were scoring their winning touchdown, and that's because the the Patriots took their better defensive players off the field in favor of guys like Gronk who could potentially bat down a Hail Mary pass.\n\nIT'S A MIRACLE IN MIAMI pic.twitter.com/PvNMIaXBAB \u2014 The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) December 9, 2018\n\nOf course, that Hail Mary was only part of the problem for the Patriots.\n\nGostkowski also struggled in this game. When you lose by one point, every missed kick is crucial, and Gostkowski missed two of them. The Patriots kicker missed an extra point in the third quarter and a 42-yard field goal in the third quarter. Gostkowski wasn't the only Patriots player who left points on the board though, Brady also deserves some blame for the way the first half ended.\n\nWith 21 seconds left, the Patriots had a first-and-goal at Miami's two-yard line. At the minimum, the Patriots should have walked away with a field goal in this situation, but they got nothing, because Brady took a sack on third down. The problem for the Patriots is that they didn't have any timeouts left, so the clock ran out before they could run another play. The sack came one play after Brady missed a wide open Chris Hogan in the end zone.\n\nSorry to interrupt your reading, but just a quick PSA here.

Subscribe: via iTunes | via Stitcher | via TuneIn | via Google Play.\n\nIn an odd coincidence, the Patriots had another odd situation near the goal line, but this time, it happened at the end of the game. With just under two minutes to play, the Patriots were leading 30-28 and they had a first-and-goal at Miami's 7-yard line. Instead of going for a touchdown, the Patriots were apparently trying to run out the clock because they called for three straight runs. Although they did get a field goal on the drive, they left the Dolphins with 16 seconds to work with, which was all Miami needed to pull off the miracle.\n\nThe miracle for the Dolphins wasn't the final play, but the fact that a team that rarely makes so many mistakes ended up making some costly mistakes.\n\nMiami 34-33 over New England\n\nPatriots: D+\n\nJust to give you an idea of how crazy this loss was for the Patriots, it marked the first time in Tom Brady's career that New England lost a regular season game after he threw for more than 350 yards with zero interceptions. Before this week, the Patriots had been 23-0 in that situation. The one upside to this loss is that Gronk finally looked like Gronk with eight catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDolphins: A-\n\nWe don't have many rules here, but if you win on a miracle play, you get an 'A.' In the Brandon Bolden revenge game, the Dolphins won thanks to Bolden and a miracle. After only carrying the ball once all season, Bolden got two carries against New England and he made the most of them as he scored two touchdowns, one from 54 yards and one from six yards. it was probably a good feeling for Bolden, who signed with Miami this year after spending the first six seasons of his career in New England. Frank Gore also had a huge game, averaging 8.67 yards per carry on 12 rushes.\n\nNew York Jets 27-23 over Buffalo\n\nJets: B\n\nAfter missing more than a month due to injury, Jets quarterback Sam Darnold returned with a bang on Sunday. Well, first he shook off some rust, and then he returned with a bang. With the Jets trailing 23-20, Darnold led his team on an impressive 61-yard drive that ended with New York scoring the game-winning touchdown with just 1:17 left. On the drive, Darnold threw for 52 yards, which was impressive considering that he only threw for 118 yards on all of New York's other possessions combined. Of course, Darnold also got some major help from a Jets defense that sacked Josh Allen three times and forced three turnovers.\n\nBills: B-\n\nWith the way Josh Allen is running, maybe the Bills should think about becoming an option team, because this throwing thing doesn't seem to working too well for their rookie quarterback. Although Allen had another huge game on the ground (nine carries, 101 yards, one touchdown), he threw two picks, including a crushing interception on Buffalo's final drive that killed any chances the Bills had of a comeback win.\n\nNew York Giants 40-16 over Washington\n\nGiants: A+\n\nThe Giants probably could have won on Sunday with their 'D' game, but they brought their 'A' game anyway. The Giants defense terrorized Mark Sanchez, sacking him five times, with 1.5 of those coming from Olivier Vernon. The Giants also picked off Sanchez twice, including a first quarter interception that Curtis Riley returned nine yards for a touchdown. Oh, and let's not forget about Saquon Barkley, who steamrolled the Redskins for 170 yards and a touchdown on just 14 carries.\n\nRedskins: F\n\nThe Redskins haven't contacted Colin Kaepernick about their quarterback job yet, but maybe they should, just so no one has to sit through another Sanchez start ever again. Sanchez was so bad in this game that the Redskins decided to bench him in the second half for someone who hadn't thrown a regular season pass since 2011 (Josh Johnson). Sanchez finished 6 of 14 for just 38 yards and he also threw two interceptions, including a pick-six. Even if the Redskins don't sign Kaepernick, Sanchez might not start another game, and that's because Johnson came in and threw for 195 yards and a touchdown, while also adding 45 rushing yards and another touchdown on the ground. For a guy trying to shake off seven years of rust, it was actually a decent performance.\n\nKansas City 27-24 over Baltimore (OT)\n\nRavens: B\n\nBaltimore held the Chiefs to just 24 points in regulation, Kansas City's lowest total of the year, but it wasn't enough for the Ravens, because their offense couldn't come through in the clutch. The Ravens offense had two chances to end this game with a touchdown, but they came up empty both times. One of those chances came at the end of regulation, but the Ravens drive quickly ended after Lamar Jackson lost a fumble. Lamar Jackson's accuracy (13 of 24 for 147 yards) is still an issue, and it will be interesting to see what the Ravens do once Joe Flacco is completely healthy.\n\nChiefs: B+\n\nPatrick Mahomes might have locked up the MVP vote with the way he played on Sunday. Going up against the NFL's top defense, Mahomes threw for 377 yards and two touchdowns. Although he's put up bigger numbers this season, this game might have been his most impressive performance. Mahomes made multiple clutch throws, including an amazing 48-yard completion to Tyreek Hill on fourth-and-9 with 90 seconds left to play that allowed Kansas City to stay in the game. The Ravens had no answer for Hill, who caught eight passes for 139 yards. Defensively, Justin Houston might have saved the game for Kansas city when he stripped Lamar Jackson and the Chiefs recovered on Baltimore's final offensive possession of regulation.\n\nNew Orleans 28-14 over Tampa Bay\n\nSaints: B\n\nAfter sleep-walking through the first half, the Saints offense caught fire in the second half, With Tampa leading 14-3 in the third quarter, the Bucs went on a roll where they scored a touchdown on three straight possessions. Drew Brees made up for two early turnovers with a rushing touchdown and a passing touchdown. Defensively, the Saints held the Bucs to just 81 yards in the second half after getting rolled for 198 yards in the first half. Cameron Jordan came up big for New Orleans by tallying two of his team's four sacks.\n\nBuccaneers: C+\n\nThe Buccaneers might have been able to pull off the upset in this game if their special teams didn't decide to take the day off. Not only did kicker Cairo Santos miss two field goals (46, 40), but the Bucs also had a punt blocked in the third quarter that basically let New Orleans back in the game. Having a punt blocked seemed to deflate the Buccaneers because they only totaled 33 yards on their final four offensive possessions combined.\n\nCleveland 26-20 over Carolina\n\nPanthers: C\n\nIf you've been watching the Panthers during their losing streak, which has not reached five games, you've probably noticed a formula: Christian McCaffrey keeps the Panthers in the game and then Cam Newton loses it. McCaffrey had a big game in Cleveland (22 touches, 101 yards, two touchdowns), but Newton couldn't get it down done the stretch. With Carolina sitting at Cleveland's 3-yard line and less than four minutes left to play, Newton couldn't get his team in the end zone. The Panthers quarterback actually got another shot to lead a comeback, but he threw an interception on Carolina's final possession of the game. Newton has now thrown eight picks over the Panthers' past five games after just throwing four interceptions through Carolina's first eight games.\n\nBrowns: B\n\nThe Bake Show is for real. Although the Browns made plenty of mistakes in this game (two lost fumbles, missed extra point), they won because Baker Mayfield was nearly perfect. Mayfield completed 18 of 22 passes for 238 yards and a touchdown against Carolina. Mayfield also got some serious help from Jarvis Landry, who became Cleveland's version of Christian McCaffrey. Not only did he catch three passes for 57 yards and a touchdown, but he also added 54 yards on the ground and a rushing touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay 34-20 over Atlanta\n\nFalcons: D-\n\nAfter scoring a touchdown on their opening drive, the Falcons offense went colder than the outdoor temperature in Green Bay. Here's what happened on their six possessions after the TD: Missed field goal, punt, Matt Ryan throws a pick-six, punt, punt, punt. It was an ugly performance for a Falcons offense that did most of its damage in garbage time.\n\nPackers: A-\n\nIn their first game since firing Mike McCarthy, the Packers arguably had one of their most impressive all-around performances of the season. Defensively, the Packers came up with multiple big plays, including a 22-yard pick-six by Bashaud Breeland in the second quarter that basically turned the game into a rout. Offensively, Aaron Rodgers showed off his arm and his legs. Not only did the Packers quarterback throw for 196 yards and two touchdowns, but he also ran for 44 yards. Davante Adams continued an impressive season with seven catches for 81 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIndianapolis 24-21 over Houston\n\nColts: A\n\nAndrew Luck might get all the headlines, but the Colts defense continues to come up big for Indianapolis. A big reason the Colts were able to pull off this upset is because Indy absolutely harassed Deshaun Watson. The Colts sacked Watson five times in the game, with two of those coming from Denico Autry. Of course, Luck probably also deserves some credit for this win. All he did was throw for 399 yards and two touchdowns in a game that the Colts had to win if they wanted to keep their playoff hopes alive and their chances of winning the AFC South. Nearly half of Luck's passing yards went to T.Y. Hilton, who caught nine passes for 199 yards, which was the second-highest total of his career. Hilton seems to love Houston: The receiver has only gone over 175 yards a total of four times in his career and three of them have come in Houston.\n\nTexans: C\n\nThe Texans nine-game winning streak came to an ugly end in this game. The Texans biggest problem is that their offense just never got into any rhythm against the Colts. Deshaun Watson got sacked five times and rarely had time to throw. The Texans tried to take some pressure off Watson by going to their ground game, but the Colts shut that down, holding Houston to just 89 yards on 25 carries. The offensive struggles meant three three-and-outs and a season-high eight punts for Trevor Daniel.\n\nSan Francisco 20-14 over Denver\n\nBroncos: C\n\nAll you need to know about this game is that the Broncos couldn't move the ball on a 49ers defense that was came into the week giving up 28 points per game, which ranked 28th in the NFL. The Broncos offense works best when they can get the running game going, but Phillip Lindsay (14 carries, 30 yards) got shut down by the 49ers.\n\n49ers: A\n\nIt looks like the 49ers might have found their newest version of Joe Montana to Jerry Rice and it's Nick Mullens to George Kittle. Wait, what? OK, those two might not be on the Montana-Rice level just yet, but they did combine for a monster game to lead the 49ers to the upset win. Kittle caught seven passes for 210 yards, which is the second highest total ever for a tight end. As for Mullens, he completed 20 of 33 passes for 332 yards and two touchdowns. It was an impressive performance for a rookie quarterback going up against one of the best defenses in the NFL.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers 26-21 over Cincinnati\n\nBengals: B\n\nIt took 14 weeks, but the Bengals finally figured out what makes their offense work, and that's giving the ball to Joe Mixon. Mixon kept the Bengals in this game by running all over the Chargers defense with 26 carries for 111 yards and a touchdown. Of course, the biggest surprise in this game is that the Bengals defense was able to hold the Chargers to just 288 yards, which marks just the second time this season they've held a team under 300 yards and is the lowest total Cincinnati has allowed all year.\n\nChargers: C\n\nWith a showdown looming on Thursday against the Chiefs, it almost looked like the Chargers were sleep-walking through this game. In a twist, the best performance of the game for the Chargers might have actually come from their kicker. The team that always seems to struggle at the position got a 4-for-4 performance from Michael Badgley, which included a franchise record 59-yard field goal to end the first half.\n\nOakland 24-21 over Pittsburgh\n\nSteelers: D-\n\nFlying to the west coast always seems to turn into a nightmare for the Steelers and that continued on Sunday. The Steelers had to play part of this game without Ben Roethlisberger, who left with a rib injury. However, Big Ben did return and set the Steelers up for a possible game-tying field goal, but Chris Boswell slipped and missed his 40-yard attempt on the final play of the game. Boswell also missed a field goal attempt from 39 yards in what has been a disastrous season. With the loss, Roethlisberger is now 0-4 all-time in Oakland.\n\nRaiders: B+\n\nAfter the Raiders defense kept things close for three quarters, Derek Carr took over in the fourth quarter and won the game for Oakland. With the Raiders trailing 14-10 to start the quarter, Carr led his team on two scoring drives where he threw for a total of 131 yards and two touchdowns. The Steelers defense had no idea how to stop Jared Cook, who caught seven passes for 116 yards.\n\nDallas 29-23 over Philadelphia (OT)\n\nEagles: B-\n\nDoug Pederson loves to take risks and maybe he should have taken one by going for two after his team scored a game-tying touchdown with just 1:39 left to play in regulation. The reason for that is because the Eagles defense looked exhausted, which made sense, considering they were on the field for 45 minutes in this game. Although the Eagles defense gave up 576 yards -- the team's most since 1966 -- it's hard to fault them for the loss. Philly's offense did absolutely nothing in the first half and this game could have easily turned into a blowout if the Eagles defense didn't come up with several huge turnovers.\n\nCowboys: B\n\nThe Cowboys could have given up two first-round picks for Amari Cooper and they'd probably still feel like they won the trade after what Cooper did to the Eagles. The former Raiders receiver exploded on Philadelphia, catching 10 passes for 217 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winning touchdown from 15 yards away in overtime. Of course, let's not forget about Ezekiel Elliott who was a perfect compliment to Cooper with 193 total yards (114 rushing, 79 receiving).\n\nDetroit 17-3 over Arizona\n\nLions: C+\n\nThe Lions got a pick-six from Darius Slay in the third quarter and that was basically all they needed to beat Arizona. Slay's score was big because the Lions offense couldn't move the ball at all on the Cardinals. The Lions totaled just 218 yards, which marks just the second time since 2011 that they've been held under 220.\n\nCardinals: C-\n\nThe Cardinals defense forced a turnover and held Matthew Stafford to the second-lowest passing total of his career (101 yards), but it wasn't enough, because the Cards couldn't get anything going on offense. Josh Rosen got sacked three times and giving the ball to David Johnson wasn't really an option, because the Lions were ready for him. Johnson totaled just 61 yards on 23 touches, which is an ugly 2.65 yards per touch.\n\nChicago 15-6 over Los Angeles Rams\n\nRams: C-\n\nThis game was basically a disaster from start to finish for the Rams offense. Playing in the ice cold weather of Chicago, Jared Goff looked highly uncomfortable all night. The Rams quarterback threw a career-high four interceptions in a game where the Rams didn't even hit the 225-yard mark on offense. Things were so ugly that the Rams were held to their lowest point total under Sean McVay (six) and their lowest yardage total (214). The Rams defense kept things interesting by picking off Mitchell Trubisky three times, but in the end, it meant nothing, because L.A.s offense couldn't capitalize on the Bears' mistakes. Of course, the good news for the Rams is that if they earn at least the two-seed in the NFC, they won't have to play in any more games in the arctic weather they saw in Chicago.\n\nBears: B+\n\nIt's not easy to shut down the second-highest scoring team in the NFL, but that's exactly what the Bears defense did on Sunday. The Bears defense almost single-handedly won this game with a performance that included four interceptions, three sacks and a safety. Chicago also shut down Todd Gurley, holding him to just 28 yards, the third lowest total of his career. Even more impressive is probably the fact that the Bears kept the Rams out of the end zone, marking the first time in the Sean McVay era that the Rams didn't score a TD.\n\nSeattle 21-7 over Minnesota\n\nVikings: C-\n\nThe Vikings might be having buyer's remorse with Kirk Cousins after the way he played in Seattle. Although Cousins threw for 208 yards, 70 of those came during garbage-time on the Vikings' final drive when the game was well out of reach. During non-garbage time, Minnesota's $84 million man couldn't get the Vikings offense going at all. In the first half, Cousins threw for just 27 yards, which was the lowest of his career for a first half. Although the scoreboard says this was a beatdown, this was actually a close game until the Vikings had a field goal blocked in the fourth quarter on a controversial play. Seattle's Bobby Wagner illegally used his teammate as leverage to jump over the line and block the kick, but no flag was thrown. At that point, the score was 6-0. After that, the Seahawks scored two touchdowns, including one that came off a Cousins fumble. Vikings coach Mike Zimmer probably isn't going to be happy with Cousins or the refs after both their performances in Seattle.\n\nSeahawks: A\n\nIf the NFL handed out an award for best defensive performance of the season, the Seahawks would probably win it for what they did to the Vikings on Monday. In an absolute masterpiece, the Seahawks defense scored a touchdown, had a goal line stand and blocked a field goal as they basically willed Seattle to a win. Offensively, although the Seahawks did absolutely nothing through the air (Russell Wilson threw for just 72 yards and also had an inexplicable interception), the ground attack more than made up for air struggles with a 214-yard performance. The Seahawks rushing performance was extra impressive because it came against a Vikings defense that was giving up less than 100 yards per game on the ground.", "keywords": ["grades", "week", "defense", "yards", "selfdestructing", "touchdown", "play", "game", "patriots", "vikings", "d", "threw", "14", "field", "came", "win", "nfl", "offense", "seahawks"], "summary": "The Patriots kicker missed an extra point in the third quarter and a 42-yard field goal in the third quarter.\nThe sack came one play after Brady missed a wide open Chris Hogan in the end zone.\nWith just under two minutes to play, the Patriots were leading 30-28 and they had a first-and-goal at Miami's 7-yard line.\nInstead of going for a touchdown, the Patriots were apparently trying to run out the clock because they called for three straight runs.\nSeahawks: AIf the NFL handed out an award for best defensive performance of the season, the Seahawks would probably win it for what they did to the Vikings on Monday."}, {"link": "https://www.sny.tv/giants/news/giants-may-be-closer-to-a-playoff-run-even-with-eli-manning-at-qb/301676630", "published": "2018-12-11T01:35:13", "title": "Giants may be closer to a playoff run, even with Eli Manning at QB", "author": [], "text": "Ralph Vacchiano | Facebook | Twitter | Archive\n\nThe revisionist history from the Giants is that they were never in a win-now mode, even though almost every move they made in the offseason seemed to indicate they were. Regardless, it obviously didn't work. They badly overestimated the talent on their roster.\n\n\n\nThe Giants simply weren't capable of winning now.\n\n\n\nBut maybe now they are.\n\n\n\nNot now -- as in this season, even with the playoffs still within mathematical reach. Those chances were lost months ago in their 1-7 start. But out of the ashes, the Giants have won four of their last five, and it's starting to look like they've found a winning formula. And just maybe their recent surge and offensive revival behind Saquon Barkley and Eli Manning proves they're closer than almost anybody thought they really were.\n\n\n\n\"Years are connected,\" Giants coach Pat Shurmur said after Sunday's 40-16 win at Washington. \"And I think that's what we're trying to do.\"\n\nThat is why Shurmur kept his foot on the gas, even when the future could've been served better by higher draft position. His belief has been that if he could re-teach his players how to win and establish a positive culture even at the end of this mess of a season, it could carry over into 2019. And if it did, he believed the Giants would still have enough talent to win.\n\nThat's a slippery slope to be sure -- judging a team and its future based on how they performed at the end of a lost season with all the pressure off. But it's still hard to deny the things they see with their own eyes. What the Giants have done since the bye week -- going 4-1 and averaging 31.4 points per game -- clearly works.\n\nAnd there may be no reason at all that it won't work next season too, even -- and maybe especially -- if Manning returns.\n\n\n\nThe key has been Barkley. Shurmur admitted he refocused his offense around the stellar rookie running back, and the results have been outstanding. He's rushed for 605 yards in five games on 6.2 yards per carry, and he has 738 total yards and six total touchdowns. He's also topped 100 rushing yards in four straight games.\n\nBut Barkley hasn't exactly done it alone.\n\n\"It all goes hand in hand,\" Shurmur said. \"You just can't put Joe Schmo in at quarterback and think you're going to win games. You've got to have a guy that can play the position.\"\n\nAnd Manning, just when it seemed the fan base and maybe the organization was ready to move on from him, proved he could still play the position, especially when he has sufficient blocking up front. With Barkley mesmerizing defenses, Manning has completed 66.4 percent of his passes over the last five weeks for 1,083 yards with 10 touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nOf course, none of it would have happened if the offensive line hadn't improved the way it seemed to do as soon as the Giants claimed right guard Jamon Brown off waivers from the Rams. But now with Barkley not getting constantly pounded behind the line of scrimmage and Manning not constantly running for his life, the young runner and the aging quarterback seem to make quite a team.\n\n\"The best friend of a quarterback is really the running back, because he can take some pressure off of him,\" Shurmur said. \"But the running back can't do it unless you block for him, so it's all connected. That's what we're seeing. I think from an offensive standpoint we're seeing a much better connection, that's the way I would phrase it, since the bye -- blocking, running, throwing, scoring points.\"\n\nIt is what they're seeing, and it's what they envisioned during the offseason. It's part of why they drafted Barkley second overall, to try and make one more run under Manning, rather than draft Sam Darnold or Josh Rosen so they could develop Manning's heir. They believed, as Shurmur famously said, that Manning had \"years\" left as a top quarterback, and with only two years remaining on his contract they decided to go for it now.\n\nNow, Manning has just one year left on his deal and he'll turn 38 in less than a month. But his heir is still not on the Giants' roster, and there's no guarantee they'll find him in the NFL draft. So why not load up on offensive linemen and pass rushers in the offseason and try to make that one last run?\n\nThey might, if they believe that this recent surge isn't a mirage. They'll have a better idea over the final three games, each one against a playoff contender. But if they think the Manning-Barkley tandem can be a formidable weapon, especially with a healthy Odell Beckham Jr., they'll use their limited salary cap freedom and a likely top-15 draft pick to see if they can plug enough holes to make that run at the playoffs they thought they'd make this year.\n\nBecause this season has shown the Giants, even after a hideous start, aren't far away from being playoff-caliber when 8-8 or 9-7 is all that it takes. Their history proves anything can happen if they can just somehow squeak in. The Giants also have learned the hard way that these opportunities don't come around often, and it could be a while before the next one if they start over with a rookie quarterback.\n\nSo why not let Manning and Barkley team up for one more shot in 2019 before moving on to the unknown future? Maybe the first eight games was just about them figuring out how to do it.\n\nNow that they have, it could be fun to see what they're really able to do.", "keywords": ["season", "quarterback", "think", "eli", "running", "maybe", "shurmur", "giants", "yards", "run", "playoff", "closer", "barkley", "manning", "qb"], "summary": "And just maybe their recent surge and offensive revival behind Saquon Barkley and Eli Manning proves they're closer than almost anybody thought they really were.\n\"Years are connected,\" Giants coach Pat Shurmur said after Sunday's 40-16 win at Washington.\nWhat the Giants have done since the bye week -- going 4-1 and averaging 31.4 points per game -- clearly works.\nAnd there may be no reason at all that it won't work next season too, even -- and maybe especially -- if Manning returns.\nSo why not let Manning and Barkley team up for one more shot in 2019 before moving on to the unknown future?"}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/sports/harold-baines-hall-of-fame.html", "published": "2018-12-11T01:02:54", "title": "Harold Baines and the Election That Could Change Cooperstown", "author": ["Tyler Kepner"], "text": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Harold Baines has been a punch line before.

Murray ran away with college football\u2019s most famous award, capturing 517 of 878 first-place votes and 2,167 points. Tagovailoa earned 299 first-place votes and 1,871 points, the most points by a runner-up in Heisman history.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough for Tagovailoa\u2019s teammates and supporters. And now the Heisman has somehow become College Football Playoff bulletin board material for Alabama, a team that\u2019s already a two-touchdown favorite against Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl on Dec. 29. You can bet Alabama strength coach Scott Cochran, known for his supercharged motivational tactics, will have a field day with this one.\n\nPunter Mike Bernier and offensive line coach Brent Key both tweeted the weekend\u2019s simple rallying cry: \u201c#Dec29.\u201d\n\nTagovailoa had been the clear frontrunner all season. The sophomore produced one of the finest seasons by a quarterback in Alabama history without playing a full game. He didn\u2019t throw an interception until Nov. 3 (against LSU) and finished the regular season completing 67.7% of his passes for 3,353 yards with 37 touchdowns and only four interceptions. His explosiveness powered Alabama to score a touchdown on its opening drive in 10 of 13 games, and those possessions averaged 1:55 in length.\n\nHis candidacy took a hit in the SEC championship game when he completed 10 of 25 passes with one touchdown and two interceptions (doubling his season total at that point), and ultimately left the game with a high ankle sprain. He had surgery a couple days later and wore a walking boot during last week\u2019s Heisman festivities in New York City. Alabama trainer Jeff Allen taped him up for the ceremony so that if he won, he wouldn\u2019t have to accept the award while wearing such a bulky brace.\n\nBut it was Murray who became Oklahoma\u2019s second Heisman winner in as many years\u2014and seventh all-time. The two-sport star threw for 4,053 yards, rushed for 892, and scored 51 total touchdowns on the way to leading the Sooners to a fourth consecutive Big 12 championship.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy is not a Most Valuable Player award, but Murray impressively carried Oklahoma to narrow November wins over Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and West Virginia and then avenged a loss to Texas in the conference title matchup. He\u2019ll lead OU to its third playoff semifinal in five years before joining the Oakland Athletics organization, which selected him ninth overall in last spring\u2019s Major League Baseball draft.\n\nAlabama players don\u2019t care too much for that stuff.

The two teams squared off earlier in the season in Week 4. Houston was winless at the time, but its victory over the Colts sparked a win streak that shot it into first place in the AFC South. It took some familiar fireworks between quarterback Andrew Luck and wide receiver T.Y. Hilton, but the Colts were able to stop a streak they felt poorly about allowing to start in the first place. Luck and Hilton lead a group of Colts who graded near the top of their positions across the NFL according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nAndrew Luck Quarterback No. 2 (90.4), 67 snaps (100 percent) Two of Luck's three highest-graded games this year have been against Houston \u2014 Sunday being No. 2. On the day, Luck went 27-of-41 passing (65.9 percent) for 399 yards (9.7 YPA), two touchdowns and one interception, which was the result of a tipped/dropped pass. Luck's 399 yards was his second-highest total of the year (and the fourth-highest of his career), and his 9.7 YPA was his third-highest. Sunday was also the sixth time in the last seven games that Luck has had a passer rating better than 100. The leader of the Colts' offense was surgical on Sunday, especially in the second half when he went 10-of-13 (76.9 percent) for 162 yards and a touchdown (143.8 rating). One of Luck's biggest plays came with just two minutes remaining in the game and the Colts up, 24-21. Needing a first down to run out the clock, Luck drew Texans edge defender Jadeveon Clowney offsides, resulting in the new set of downs that the Colts needed. \u201cYeah, we were getting ready to call a timeout. In fact, we were real close to calling a timeout, because it didn\u2019t look like they were going to jump,\" Colts head coach Frank Reich said to reporters after the game. \"It didn\u2019t look like they were going to jump. But I just got to credit Andrew and the way he handled it. First, he came out, broke the huddle like we were going to speed snap it, we didn\u2019t, they held on, and then, sometimes what you do, is you do that and you hold, and you try to get them to soften in and you snap it at the last second thinking. So, he hung with it, and hung with it and it eventually got him.\u201d\n\nT.Y. Hilton Wide Receiver No. 4 (86.6), 54 snaps (81 percent) The prime beneficiary from Luck's hot outing was Hilton, who seems to blow up anytime he plays in Houston. Perhaps he should invest in real estate there? Hilton caught 9-of-12 balls thrown his way for a season-high 199 yards (22.1 avg), resulting in five first downs and a 116.7 passer rating when Luck targeted Hilton. The Ghost also accumulated 58 yards after the catch. Hilton's performance moved him past Hall-of-Fame receiver Marvin Harrison for the most 150-yard receiving games (11) in franchise history. \u201cYeah, I think throughout the week we noticed some things where we thought we could take advantage of T.Y.\u2019s speed and his maneuverability. T.Y. does some things very special. He does somethings that not many other people can do,\" Luck said after the game. \"So we saw I think some opportunities through film that we thought we could take advantage of. Once we got that first one, it was like ok, yeah here we go, let\u2019s get it. When T.Y.\u2019s in the zone, he\u2019s in the zone, man. It\u2019s fun to play with him. It\u2019s an honor to play with him, and I sincerely mean that.\u201d\n\nClayton Geathers Safety No. 10 (75.4), 68 snaps (94 percent) PFF considered this Geathers' second-best performance of the season, as he totaled nine tackles and a pass breakup. He also had an interception overturned on a questionable penalty down on the Colts' goal line in the first half. Geathers was credited with three \"stops,\" which constitutes a \"loss\" for the opposing offense. He was targeted five times, allowing three catches for just seven yards (2.3 avg). \"He played his butt off. That's somebody we depend on. That's one of our captains, and he definitely delivered for us,\" tight end Eric Ebron said after the game when singling Geathers out for his performance.\n\nAdam Vinatieri Kicker No. 4 (69.2), 4 snaps (14 percent) No surprise here. The Ageless Wonder converted all three extra-point attempts as well as his lone field goal attempt \u2014 a 54-yarder \u2014 in a building in which he has grown quite comfortable. Vinatieri's 54-yard field goal ties him with Phil Dawson and John Kasay (42) for the fourth-most field goals made from 50-plus yards in NFL history. Vinatieri also became just the third person in NFL history to play 350 games, and tied Harrison (190) for the ninth-most games played in franchise history.", "keywords": ["houston", "games", "football", "history", "grades", "pro", "ty", "colts", "week", "geathers", "lucks", "yards", "unsurprisingly", "lead", "hilton", "focus", "luck", "snaps"], "summary": "Hilton, but the Colts were able to stop a streak they felt poorly about allowing to start in the first place.\nLuck and Hilton lead a group of Colts who graded near the top of their positions across the NFL according to Pro Football Focus.\n2 (90.4), 67 snaps (100 percent) Two of Luck's three highest-graded games this year have been against Houston \u2014 Sunday being No.\nSunday was also the sixth time in the last seven games that Luck has had a passer rating better than 100.\nOne of Luck's biggest plays came with just two minutes remaining in the game and the Colts up, 24-21."}, {"link": "https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/warriors-named-sportsperson-year-20181210", "published": "2018-12-10T16:09:51", "title": "Golden State Warriors Named 2018 Sports Illustrated Sportsperson Of The Year", "author": ["Posted", "Dec"], "text": "The back-to-back NBA champion Golden State Warriors have been named the 2018 Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year, it was announced today.

Rodriguez, TNS)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 They came to the desert and didn\u2019t waste much time in adding to what has now become a crowded starting rotation picture.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers signed right-hander Tyson Ross to a one-year deal on the first day of Major League Baseball\u2019s annual Winter Meetings. The deal is worth $5.75 million, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\n\u201cFor us, he\u2019s a legit pitcher and he\u2019s a good candidate to even get better in 2019,\u201d general manager Al Avila said. \u201cHis overall stuff is still pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nRoss put together a solid season in 2018, nearly two years removed from undergoing thoracic outlet surgery on his right shoulder. In 31 games with the Padres and Cardinals \u2014 23 starts \u2014 he combined to post a 4.15 ERA and 1.296 WHIP, with 122 strikeouts in 149 2/3 innings.\n\nRoss, 31, has pitched parts of nine seasons. His most success came with the Padres from 2013-15, when he posted a 3.07 ERA and 1.233 WHIP with more than a strikeout per inning. In 2014 and 2015, he made 31 and 33 starts, respectively.\n\nThough he is no longer that pitcher, Ross remains serviceable and figures to be part of the Tigers\u2019 starting rotation come next spring. Perhaps, with further improvement, the team will receive trade interest in him, which has been a stated goal in acquiring one-year players during their rebuilding process.\n\nSaid Avila: \u201cWe think he\u2019s going to fit right into our starting rotation.\u201d\n\nWith the addition of Ross, the Tigers have six qualified candidates to fill five spots: Ross, righties Jordan Zimmermann and Michael Fulmer, and lefties Matthew Boyd, Daniel Norris and Matt Moore, who signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal last month.\n\n\u201cYou need depth,\u201d Avila said. \u201cYou want competition. We\u2019re not just going to hand over the job. You gotta win the job in most of these cases.\u201d\n\nThose half-dozen pitchers do not come without injury questions: Zimmermann and Fulmer are recovering from off-season surgeries and Norris has been oft-injuried in his career. Arm injuries \u2014 especially to starting pitchers \u2014 are inevitable.\n\nBoth Moore and Ross have experience pitching out of the bullpen \u2014 Moore will likely be used as a long reliever if he does not crack the rotation and Ross posted a 2.73 ERA in a relief role with St. Louis last season \u2014 but given the salary values, Ross is being counted on for a rotation spot.\n\nAvila said the Tigers received good reports on Ross both from a scouting and medical perspective, and that the team\u2019s analytical department was in favor of the signing.\n\nHe described Ross\u2019 pitching repertoire like this: His fastball sits at 92 mph and tops out at 95 mph, with a slider between 84-86 mph and a change-up between 86-88 mph.\n\n\u201cHis stuff is still pretty good,\u201d Avila said. \u201cLast year toward the end of the year, he started pitching even better.

The Browns won and it was exciting and there was buzz, but it didn't carry the same weight as their previous wins -- not in a bad way. It just felt different.\n\nI'll never forget that Christmas Eve game against the Chargers in 2016.

All those wins felt like such landmark moments.\n\nSunday's game, though, didn't feel like an outlier. It just felt normal.\n\nThinking back a week earlier, the loss to Houston felt different, too. After two years of expecting that type of performance -- arriving at the stadium every Sunday morning knowing exactly what was going to happen that day -- it was actually surprising to see the Browns fall apart like they did in the first half.\n\nThis team has been away from the real NFL for so long that it's easy to forget how the ups and downs of the league really feel.\n\n\"Everybody loves winning,\" Myles Garrett said. \"It's a little different for us because things have been a little negative the last couple of years, but that's in the past and we're on a different path now.

The Sixers are now 19-9 on the season.\n\n\u2022 Every Embiid-Andre Drummond matchup is a must-watch, but this one was low on drama relative to the trash talking and general animosity we\u2019ve come to expect from their meetings. You may recall Embiid scored a Wells Fargo Center record 32 first-half points his last time out against Drummond, and afterward said of Drummond and Zaza Pachulia, \u201cI kicked both of their a--.\u201d\n\nDrummond did pick up a late technical foul with 3:30 left in the fourth quarter for complaining to the officials.\n\nEmbiid, who missed practice Sunday with a migraine, has been in the headlines lately because of his frustration with his offensive role along with his three-game \u201cslump,\u201d if you could call it that.\n\nThough Embiid made his first shot, a three-pointer from the right wing with Drummond\u2019s hand in his face, that jumper didn\u2019t foreshadow Embiid returning to his early-season offensive dominance.\n\nEmbiid had 24 points on 6 for 16 shooting and eight rebounds and was a game-high plus-30. Drummond finished with 21 points and 16 rebounds.\n\n\u2022 As he\u2019s made a habit of doing this season, Ben Simmons started out looking to score, using his size advantage to dunk on the 6-foot-5 Bruce Brown inside and his speed advantage to blow by Jon Leuer on the perimeter. He also broke free in transition on a couple occasions, which is never good news for Sixers opponents.\n\nWithout Griffin, the Pistons just didn\u2019t have any defenders who could counter Simmons physically or athletically. Credit Simmons for capitalizing on his edge early; he had 11 points on 5 for 5 shooting in the first quarter.\n\nSimmons finished with 18 rebounds, 10 rebounds and seven assists. His 2 for 9 free throw shooting was a notable blemish on his night.\n\n\u2022 After shooting 37.4 percent from the floor and 34.1 percent from three-point range in his first 20 games, Mike Muscala may have found his shot against the Pistons. He went for 18 points Friday in Detroit in arguably his best performance as a Sixer and had 10 points on 3 for 6 shooting, four rebounds and two assists Monday night.\n\nWhile Amir Johnson started Friday with Embiid out, it\u2019s clear Muscala is the Sixers\u2019 best option to back up Embiid. As head coach Brett Brown said pregame, Muscala is \u201cnot bashful\u201d about shooting the ball, and, though he has his limitations, his defense hasn\u2019t been bad recently.\n\n\u2022 The Sixers\u2019 bench still looks pretty thin, but a couple players outside Muscala knocked down key shots Monday. In one game, T.J. McConnell doubled his number of made three-pointers for the season (from two to four).\n\nA good ole four point teamwork play.\n\n\n\nMcConnell for three, Embiid with the bonus shot as the Sixers hold a 71-59 lead. pic.twitter.com/EpBYCiORNU \u2014 NBC Sports Philadelphia (@NBCSPhilly) December 11, 2018\n\nFurkan Korkmaz had a big third quarter, posting 10 of his career-high 18 points in the period to help the Sixers stem a Pistons run.\n\nFURK DOING WORK.\n\n\n\nHe nails a tough one from beyond for the Sixers to go up, 71-63! pic.twitter.com/f1aXQlTNI0 \u2014 NBC Sports Philadelphia (@NBCSPhilly) December 11, 2018\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They were already really strong last year and have adapted really well to the little changes Carlo Ancelotti made. They are a really good side but we are as well.\n\n\u201cThe competition is like this. You play the strongest teams and if you want to go through you have to win. We didn\u2019t win often enough to be through already. That is our mistake and now we can put it right if we perform. We all know the results we need and it is quite difficult. Napoli are good in possession, counterattack as well, typical Italian team good at defending. It\u2019s a big challenge but if something special is possible it is here and that is why we should try.\u201d\n\nLiverpool have reserved their poorest performances \u2013 their only poor performances of the season so far \u2013 for their European travels, with the 90th-minute 1-0 defeat in Naples setting the tone. Away from home Klopp\u2019s team produced a total of five shots on target in three matches, including James Milner\u2019s penalty in Paris, whereas two matches at Anfield have yielded seven goals and maximum points. Liverpool are unbeaten in 18 European home games since Real Madrid\u2019s visit in October 2014.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Klopp hails 'exceptional' Salah as Liverpool brush Bournemouth aside \u2013 video\n\n\u201cThe first game against Napoli was that bad from our side that we can improve everything,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t defend for a second like we wanted and we didn\u2019t play like we wanted to play with the ball. But that was six weeks ago. No team in the world are perfect. We are not and Napoli are not. We all have weaknesses.\n\n\u201cIt is about using the weaknesses of the opponent. If we are really in the game and the crowd is there then we can go the extra yard. That will be necessary for this game, 100%. I am really looking forward to it. It is really cool but difficult. I am really looking forward to it. It is a big opportunity for us and we will try everything to put it right.\u201d\n\nAnfield is not the only foundation for Klopp\u2019s confidence. His team could not have timed better their move to the top at Manchester City\u2019s expense, certainly not in terms of preparation for Napoli, while another clean sheet at Bournemouth, Mohamed Salah\u2019s hat-trick and the increased involvement of Naby Ke\u00efta plus Fabinho in midfield adds to a sense of growing momentum.\n\nThe pursuit of a first league championship since 1990 may be assisted by an early exit from the Champions League, it has been suggested by Gary Neville and others, but Virgil van Dijk gave that idea short shrift.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah romps to a hat-trick in 4-0 win at Bournemouth Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are Liverpool fans,\u201d said the central defender. \u201cWe want to compete on the highest level. We are top of the league now but it could change next week. You never know. The main thing is to stay at the highest level and to do everything we can to go through. It is going to be a tough game but I am very confident, like always in my team.\n\n\u201cWe need to start like we always start at home in the Champions League. We wanted to do that away too but it is not as easy as people might think. We need to start fast, set the tone, put them under pressure and play our game. Be brave, be confident and don\u2019t hide.

If we are not a Champions League club in January/February it will not be one second an excuse for anything else. We do not need to make this game any bigger than it is but it is big.

I can tell you that leading an athletic department such as Auburn's is extraordinarily rewarding yet demanding.\n\nI have embraced the privilege of making decisions that will better position our athletic department ranging from facility planning to negotiating football schedules. I've also had opportunities to spend time with members of the Auburn family while traveling from Huntsville to the coast and everywhere in between.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, a few freshman mistakes have been made, like getting lost on campus while trying to visit with deans of every college and scheduling lunch downtown on a football Friday without factoring in adequate time to secure a parking space.\n\nThankfully, I've also experienced Auburn competing at high levels. I was in Waco, Texas, when the equestrian team won its fifth national championship, in Gainesville, Florida, for baseball's Super Regional appearance, and on our home court to celebrate the recent SEC championship in men's basketball.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe duty to lead a large and complex organization with integrity that simultaneously operates as a business and an enterprise is an awesome undertaking. My charge is to enhance the experience of 550 student-athletes, maintain a balanced budget, create a vibrant departmental culture, communicate effectively to all constituents and provide fan experiences of a lifetime.\n\nThat said, this overarching responsibility is not without its challenges. To use a baseball analogy, we do not hit a home run every at-bat.\n\nA very real example of this is the most recent football season. Simply put, it did not go as planned. Having attended many practices, team and position meetings, I continue to be amazed at the effort our student-athletes and coaches pour into our storied program. After each win, I stand in the locker room and smile as the young men celebrate victory. Conversely, my heart breaks to see those same young men sit in disbelief after defeat.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, maximum effort does not always equal maximum results. Still, outcomes matter and at Auburn, we expect to deliver.\n\nSince the conclusion of the regular season, there has been speculation about the future of Auburn Football despite my previous public comments as well as statements from President Leath. Unfortunately, those rumors and speculation have not served the Auburn Family well.\n\nThroughout the season, Coach Malzahn and I had discussions focused on placing our student-athletes in the best competitive position for the future. To confirm, Coach Malzahn is dedicated to this program and he has my support as we work together to move forward. Our discussions are ongoing, and we will focus on evolving in all facets of the program to achieve better and more consistent results. Rest assured, my commitment to overseeing and managing the effort to put Auburn football back at the level we expect and you deserve will be unrelenting.\n\nWe have the most passionate fan base in the country, who love Auburn and all it represents. You, the fans, are the driving force in our effort to make you proud. Of course, it stings when we fall short of our lofty expectations, but in true Auburn fashion, we will dust ourselves off and recommit to our goals.\n\nTo reiterate, my responsibility is to serve Auburn, and more specifically, our coaches, staff and student-athletes. Among other things, successfully navigating this endeavor requires collaboration, trust, passion and resilience \u2013 qualities our young men and women learn every day as student-athletes.\n\nAs the end of football season draws near, I look forward to the upcoming bowl game and enjoying the winter sports season, which includes men's and women's basketball, gymnastics and swimming & diving.\n\nOne of the many reasons I'm happy to call Auburn home is because of your fierce loyalty to the orange and blue. Thank you for your passion, and thank you for welcoming my family with open arms.

After seeing the video of Hunt, Rice himself told NFL.com that \"you look back at it and obviously you see some similarities between what happened in my situation.\"\n\nBoth men were captured assaulting women on surveillance camera footage that probably would not have seen the light of day if celebrity gossip site TMZ had not released them. In both instances, the release of the videos led the league to implement disciplinary measures.\n\nBut experts in the fields of gender-based violence and sports say that's largely where the similarities end.\n\nThe circumstances of the encounters were as different as the men's relationships to the women. Rice knocked out his then fianc\u00e9e in an elevator in an Atlantic City casino. Hunt said he had not previously met the woman who appears in the February 10 footage from a Cleveland hotel -- and there's still plenty we don't know about Hunt's situation.\n\nInstead of getting mired in details, the conversation around Hunt should turn, they say, not to measuring him against Rice, but to bigger questions. Why is violent off-the-field behavior tolerated again and again? How often is it happening when it's not caught on video? How can we prevent it?\n\nHere's what those informed observers say we should be talking about when we discuss former Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt.\n\n1. How and when the NFL reacts and acts\n\nHunt's friend told police that the woman -- who appears to be white -- called them both a racist slur before the incident.\n\n\"It was just a disagreement, and I honestly wanted her just to leave,\" Hunt told ESPN in an interview that aired two days after the video surfaced. \"It's no excuse for me to act that way or to even put myself in that position.\"\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs waived Hunt, their star running back, hours after the footage was published. The same day, the NFL placed him on the commissioner's exempt list, meaning he cannot participate in football activities until the league completes its investigation.\n\nIn 2014, two videos emerged of Rice assaulting his then-fianc\u00e9e, now wife, Janay Palmer. Seven months after the assault, the Ravens released Rice and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.\n\n\"I'm not sure comparing the Rice and Kareem Hunt case is productive, but it is illustrative,\" said USA Today columnist Kelly Whiteside, an assistant professor of sports media and journalism at Montclair State University in New Jersey. \"Something bad happens, we react and then move on.\"\n\n\"I would not be surprised if Hunt is playing in the NFL next year, given his age and talent. Winning, and the money that follows, means too much.\"\n\nAfter the NFL admitted to mishandling Rice's case, they asked former FBI director Robert Mueller to look into what went wrong and offer the league recommendations for adjusting its discipline process. Mueller issued a 65-page report in January 2015 with a number of suggested improvements, including that the NFL more actively investigate when players are accused of domestic violence or violence against women.\n\nRice, who was reinstated by the NFL upon appeal, never played another down in the NFL after his initial suspension -- in large part because of the incident, but also because his most productive years were behind him, Whiteside said.\n\nWhiteside believes it's more illuminating to compare what's happening with Hunt to the case of Greg Hardy.\n\nHardy was convicted of assaulting a girlfriend, but then signed to a one-year $11 million contract with the Dallas Cowboys, she said.\n\n\"The Hardy case and the Hunt case show that off-the-field violence is tolerated, if an owner thinks that player can help the team win,\" she said.\n\nAnd since Rice, there have been several examples of professional athletes receiving lucrative contracts while charges are pending against them -- one of them was just days before TMZ released the Hunt video.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers released linebacker Reuben Foster the morning of November 25, hours after he was arrested on a domestic violence charge at a hotel in Tampa, Florida.\n\nTwo days later, the Washington Redskins claimed him off waivers , but he won't immediately be taking the field. Like Hunt, Foster was placed on the commissioner's exempt list while the league reviews his arrest on domestic violence charges.\n\n\"The Redskins fully understand the severity of the recent allegations made against Reuben,\" Doug Williams, the team's senior vice president of player personnel said in a statement. \"If true, you can be sure these allegations are nothing our organization would ever condone.\"\n\n2. How video evidence seems to force action\n\nBoth cases do have one important thing in common: they reveal instances of violence that were hidden from the public eye -- or at the very least, \"not searched out diligently\" by the NFL or the teams the athletes played for, said Michael Kasdan, director of special projects for The Good Men Project , which collects and publishes stories and research about modern masculinity.\n\n\"What if there was no video?\" said author and activist Kevin Powell. \"Would we be having this conversation right now? No, I don't think so.\"\n\nTMZ released video on February 19, 2014, showing Rice dragging an apparently unconscious woman from an elevator four days earlier. After the early-morning fight, the two were arrested and each was charged with simple assault.\n\nOne month later, Rice was indicted on a charge of aggravated assault and the charge against Palmer was dropped. The couple married the next day, on March 28.\n\nRice pleaded not guilty in May and entered a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that would clear him of charges in one year. Amid criticism that the punishments from the NFL and criminal justice system were too light, Rice received a two-game suspension and a fine in July 2014.\n\nMore outrage followed when, in September 2014, TMZ released video from inside the elevator showing Rice knocking Palmer to the ground. The same day, the Baltimore Ravens released him and the NFL and suspended him indefinitely -- seven months after the incident.\n\nEven before the second video came out, though, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell admitted that the two-game suspension was too lenient and created a discipline standard: Any players who violated the league's personal conduct policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault with physical force would be suspended six games for a first offense. Despite its discipline policy, the NFL has not held fast to that six-game standard in several incidents of violence against women.\n\nWith Hunt, the league and Cleveland police have provided conflicting responses regarding when the league first received or reviewed police reports or the surveillance footage.\n\nThe league said it began investigating immediately after the altercation. No arrests were made as a result of the incident and Hunt has not been charged with a crime, according to Cleveland Police.\n\nA police spokesperson said the league didn't make a formal request for police records or the surveillance video until November 30, the same day TMZ published the surveillance video. An NFL spokesperson disputed the Cleveland Police statement, noting they \"had multiple verbal conversations with Cleveland police officers and requested surveillance video immediately upon learning of the incident in February.\"\n\nThe league said it was unable to get access to the hotel video and was not able to speak with the complainants in the hotel fight. Hunt told ESPN the league did not interview him -- but he admitted to lying about the incident to the Chiefs.\n\nWhen the video surfaced on November 30 through TMZ, the consequences were swift. Now, Hunt is on the defensive as he has been accused of two more violent acts -- before and after the Cleveland incident.\n\nAn agent representing Hunt did not respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\n3. The larger issue of violence against women\n\nViolence against women is not just an NFL problem, it's a societal problem, Whiteside points out.\n\n\"In many ways, sports are this nation's front porch,\" she said, pointing to how the Rice video put the issue of domestic violence in the headlines.\n\nBut when these incidents thrust the issue of off-the-field violence into the spotlight, we have an opportunity for a national reckoning, she said -- and that opportunity is too often squandered.\n\n\"The discussion of difficult issues in sports raises the public's consciousness even if a significant portion of America wants its athletes to shut up and dribble ... or tackle.\"\n\nSports fans might be tempted to look at high-profile cases of off-the-field violence and rank them in comparison to each other. After all, that's how the criminal justice system works: it evaluates the severity of a crime and assigns punishment based on numerous factors, including the nature of the offense and the offender, including his background, likelihood of reoffending and amenability to treatment.\n\nBut when it comes to empathizing with victims, the same sliding scale should not apply, said Powell, author of \"The Education of Kevin Powell: A Boy's Journey Into Manhood.\"\n\n\"It's all bad,\" he said of the incidents involving Rice and Hunt. \"They're both women and both human beings, no matter their relationship to them.\"\n\n4. What might cause men to be violent\n\nViolence against another person is never excusable, said Lisa Hickey, publisher of The Good Men Project and CEO of Good Men Media Inc.\n\nBut violence does not occur in a vacuum, and it's important to understand how popular culture and society minimizes and normalizes abuse, including in sports, she said.\n\n\"The NFL looks for players who are aggressive -- and, by definition, that means they have to be OK with harming themselves and others,\" Hickey said.\n\nWhile we don't know how much this is the case in Rice or Hunt's private lives, it's clear football is a violent sport. Research shows that the repeated blows athletes experience can cause brain damage that may develop into Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which may lead to behaviors such as increased aggression, risk-taking, and loss of executive function, she said.\n\nSystemic racism is also a form of abuse, Hickey said. Using the n-word is a form of racial violence, although \"we, as a society, have failed to understand the implications of repetitive racial violence over time and the trauma it causes.\"\n\n\"Players are also coached to be violent, and then are expected to turn off the violence when they leave the field. The cycle of violence escalates and then we are surprised when violence spills off the field and into other areas,\" Hickey said.\n\n\"One of those areas it often spills to is violence against women -- and violence against women is normalized in our society to such an extent that not only do we fail to do enough to prevent it -- we often don't even see it until there is a video as extreme as the ones with Kareem Hunt or Ray Rice,\" she said.\n\nResearch shows that, oftentimes, people who are violent were themselves victims of abuse , and it can influence their behavior. Powell says he knows this firsthand as someone who experienced childhood violence and went on to become physically violent toward others, including one instance in which he pushed a girlfriend. His life experiences inform his current work as a speaker and mentor who visits schools and workplaces to discuss toxic masculinity.\n\n\"You can't keep getting in trouble and think there's no problem,\" he said. \"You have to be the person to defuse the situation. You have to walk away.\"\n\nHe points to reports that one month before the Cleveland incident, Hunt was accused in a nightclub brawl in Kansas City, Missouri. The altercation involved six to eight others that left a man with a broken nose and rib, according to police. Three months later, he reportedly punched another man in the face at an Ohio resort. Neither incident led to criminal charges.\n\n\"There's something very jarring about that, when someone's constantly getting in trouble,\" Powell said. \"You have to ask, 'what's going on? Why is no one intervening here? You need to get some help.'\"\n\nRice told a reporter for NFL's website that he'd be happy to talk to Hunt about what he'd learned since his suspension.\n\n\"I'm never going to call myself an expert. I've discussed the remorse I have for survivors of domestic violence,\" he said, \"but knowing what I know now, the top priority is learning that it comes down to those split-second decisions, which come at the most hostile times. And that's where this could be a teaching tool.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct a reference made to Kevin Powell and his past experiences.

Donovan Mitchell predicted on Sunday night that the Thunder would come out with some added energy against Utah. The same type the Jazz had the first time they played Houston.\n\nThat prediction was spot on.\n\nThe Thunder were active on the defensive end, aggressive on offense and simply overwhelmed the Jazz on Monday. OKC forced 20 Utah turnovers on the night and got hands on a number of other passes.\n\n\u201cWe were just alert, locked in, dialed in,\u201d George said. \u201c ... The effort and energy was there.\u201d\n\nSome of the turnovers were the Thunder making good plays, but a number were the Jazz making poor decisions with the ball. There were times when Utah made errant passes into the paint or got caught in the air or was lazy on handoffs.\n\n\u201cWhen you turn the basketball over, it is hard to defend against that.\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute. That is what it came down to.\u201d\n\nWith the Thunder leading 10-8 in the opening minutes of the first quarter, Rudy Gobert picked up his second foul of the game, sending him to the bench. As Gobert walked off the court, he faked like he was going to hit the scorers table in an ode to his now infamous quick ejection against the Houston Rockets last Thursday. He could joke about that incident because the Jazz ended up winning that game.\n\nUtah didn\u2019t fare so well without their big man on Monday.\n\nThe Thunder quickly went on an 8-0 run after Gobert\u2019s second foul. The Jazz\u2019s first quarter was only salvaged by an over half-court heave from Mitchell that found the bottom of the net at the buzzer. That shot, though, didn\u2019t end up meaning much.\n\nAs good as the Thunder were to start the game, they were better to start the second half. OKC scored 42 points in the third quarter to take a commanding lead into the fourth quarter. George was the main catalyst to the OKC offense, going 8-for-10 from the field and hitting five 3-pointers.\n\n\u201cPaul George was terrific,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWhat he did \u2014 there are some things you could do better and there were plays that he made that were big-time plays.\u201d\n\nA number of those plays came in the 3rd quarter when he hit a number of shots that halted would-be Utah runs.\n\n\u201cFinding creases, finding space, freeing my hands to get shots and to get looks,\u201d George said about his offensive performance. \u201cI caught fire and kept going.\u201d\n\nThe Thunder led by as many as 29 points in the game, reminding Mitchell of time of Game 5 in the playoffs when OKC went a big 2nd-half run that won the Thunder that game.\n\n\u201cExcept it was the whole game,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nRussell Westbrook finished with just 12 points, but his off night didn't hurt the Thunder. George got plenty of help from Steven Adams, who had 22 points, and Dennis Schroeder, who finished with 23 points.\n\nFor the Jazz, the same problems that have popped in many of their lopsided losses were there once again. Utah struggled to shoot the deep ball, going 8-for-29 from the 3-point line. The Jazz struggled taking care of the ball, finishing with 20 turnovers. And they struggled to defend in transition and pretty much everywhere else, allowing the Thunder to shoot over 50 percent from the field.\n\nThe Jazz drop to 13-15 on the season.\n\nMitchell led Utah with 19 points.

They\u2019ll Have to Acquire One.", "author": ["Dec"], "text": "The Houston Rockets are owners of the league\u2019s eighth-worst record at 11-14. It\u2019s startling for a number of reasons, not least of which is how convincing the team was as a legitimate challenger to the Warriors last season, taking a 65-win campaign all the way to Game 7 of the 2018 Western Conference finals. Nothing has gone according to plan since. The Rockets are on pace for 36 wins, which would go down as the third-worst follow-up to a season with 60 wins or more in NBA history. It\u2019d trail only the Cavaliers after LeBron James took his talents to South Beach, and the Bulls following Michael Jordan\u2019s second retirement.\n\nOf the 10 biggest drop-offs we\u2019ve seen in NBA history that fit those criteria, most teams on the list got worse because they lost a star: Shaquille O\u2019Neal left the Magic in free agency; Wilt Chamberlain retired from the Lakers; the Pacers lost Jermaine O\u2019Neal, Ron Artest, and Stephen Jackson to suspension after the Malice at the Palace; the Kawhi Leonard drama of last season left the Spurs without a true game-changing presence. Houston is fueled by the same star power it had last season, yet the team is crumbling. The Rockets defense dropped from seventh best to sixth worst and their offense slipped from first to seventh.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, the Rockets don\u2019t have a catch-all excuse for their play this season. Chris Paul is hampered by a hamstring injury, and at age 33 has shown subtle signs of decline. Eric Gordon has apparently forgotten how to score. The team isn\u2019t shooting well from 3 and lacks depth at every position. There\u2019s also an unquantifiable sense that this team lacks the supreme confidence and drive it had last season; Houston was single-mindedly focused on knocking off the Warriors last season, only to come up short in Game 7 after missing 27 straight 3s \u2014 and the 3-pointer is the shot that defines their analytically driven system. It doesn\u2019t take a lot for doubt to start creeping in.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear starting point to explain the Rockets\u2019 struggles. In a vacuum, Houston\u2019s most significant losses this summer \u2014 role players Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute to free agency \u2014 pale in comparison to losing a star player, but having dependable role players is a necessary ingredient to the championship recipe. The Rockets still have P.J. Tucker, but of the 1,054 minutes that Tucker shared the floor with center Clint Capela last season, 943 came with at least one of Ariza or Mbah a Moute on the floor. Those minutes that previously went to Ariza and Mbah a Moute have gone to youngsters like Gary Clark and Danuel House, journeymen like James Ennis III, and rusty turnstiles like Carmelo Anthony.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Houston necessarily made the wrong decision when it let Ariza and Mbah a Moute go; they aren\u2019t LeBron and Jordan, and besides, Ariza, 33, is either washed up or playing like he wants out of Phoenix, and Mbah a Moute, 32, has played only four games this season while battling injuries to his right calf and left knee. It\u2019s just that their replacements haven\u2019t been able to replicate any of the magic the Rockets got out of the two-way, multipositional players last season. The substitutes haven\u2019t contained penetration in man-to-man situations, they haven\u2019t played smart help defense, and they haven\u2019t rebounded, all of which is integral to the team\u2019s defensive scheme, which relies heavily on switching across positions. The return of Rockets defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik, who retired before the season, hasn\u2019t helped.\n\nThe Rockets have their bigs\u2014Capela, Nene, or Isaiah Hartenstein\u2014switch onto ball handlers, which can leave a perimeter defender on a larger, stronger player inside. They switch more screens than any other team, which allows opponents to choose their own matchups as though they were playing a video game. Opposing teams are giving the Rockets a taste of their own medicine by pick-and-rolling them to death, then exploiting mismatches on switches; the goal is to get the big man away from the rim with a switch because it opens the floodgates to the paint. Teams finish 19.4 percent of their possessions using isolations against Houston\u2014which is the highest frequency in a Synergy Sports database that goes back to the 2004-05 season\u2014because of plays like this:\n\nCapela has defended 114 isolation possessions this season (or 4.6 per game)\u2014a significant margin over the next closest bigs, Kevon Looney (73), Joel Embiid (58), and Steven Adams (52). Capela logged only 184 all of last season. It\u2019s unfair to expect a paint enforcer like Capela to defend guards at a level necessary to consistently contain penetration. The problem is compounded because no one else on their roster can effectively protect the rim when Capela is stuck on the perimeter. Unlike last season, the Rockets don\u2019t have enough wings who know how to play big.\n\nIn the clip above, the Mavericks run an on-ball screen to get DeAndre Jordan onto Tucker, and bring Hartenstein to the perimeter. Houston has no size in the paint, and Wesley Matthews smokes Harden for a layup. Harden unsurprisingly leads all guards in isolation possessions allowed on defense. Tucker is Houston\u2019s best defender, but he can\u2019t box out a behemoth like Jordan and alter shots from driving perimeter players.\n\nThe Rockets are allowing slightly more at-rim field goal attempts than they did last season, and teams are shooting a higher percentage (67.4 percent, which ranks third worst in the NBA, per Cleaning the Glass). Teams playing Houston are getting easier shots; they\u2019re having a big man slip screens, both on the ball and off the ball, because they know a switch is coming, which can make it easy for a big to plow his way to the rim for an open basket\u2014or a foul or offensive rebound. This is the department in which Houston has gotten significantly worse. Only the Suns and Grizzlies foul more often than the Rockets, and only the Wizards allow more offensive rebounds.\n\nOffensive Rebounding and Free Throw Rate Season Opponent Offensive Rebounding % Rank Opponent Free Throw Rate Rank Season Opponent Offensive Rebounding % Rank Opponent Free Throw Rate Rank 2017-18 Rockets 4th 6th 2018-19 Rockets 28th 29th\n\nWith Ariza and Mbah a Moute, the Rockets were more effective at executing a \u201cscram switch,\u201d a defensive maneuver that has two players switch their assignments away from the ball to establish a more preferable matchup. In the clip below from last season, the Celtics run a handoff to get Al Horford switched onto Paul, and the Rockets respond by having Ariza and Paul switch again. Horford gets forced into a shot from the post, which Ariza strongly contests.\n\nEnnis and younger teammates like Clark and House don\u2019t offer the same resistance in the post, which means the scram switch is less effective. They also aren\u2019t as effective in man-to-man situations on the perimeter, and they\u2019re too often a beat late on rotations, which forces them to commit ticky-tack fouls at a far higher rate than Ariza and Mbah a Moute.\n\nFoul Troubles Player Fouls Per 100 Possessions Player Fouls Per 100 Possessions Trevor Ariza (2017-18) 2.8 Luc Mbah a Moute (2017-18) 3.1 Gary Clark (2018-19) 3.4 Carmelo Anthony (2018-19) 5.2 James Ennis (2018-19) 6.5 Danuel House (2018-19) 6.6\n\nThe Rockets were blowing teams off the floor last season; now, they\u2019re in survival mode most games, having to keep their best players on the floor for longer periods of time. The three-guard lineup of Harden, Paul, and Gordon is playing far more often than it did last season. Tucker is averaging seven more minutes per game, and Capela is playing 6.4 more. Capela and Tucker have already shared the floor for 663 minutes; they\u2019re on pace to exceed the 1,054 minutes those two played together last season. But the additional time spent with one another hasn\u2019t been much of a plus. The Rockets are receiving diminished returns.\n\nEven though Capela forces Luka Doncic to shoot a stepback 3 in the play above, Jordan, who was switched onto Tucker, has the sheer size advantage to inhale the offensive board and easily put it back. Teams are targeting this weakness by having bigs positioned to crash the boards more frequently; the Rockets are allowing 2.4 more second-chance points per 100 possessions.\n\nAll these defensive blunders and blemishes add up to create a less effective interior defense. Mike D\u2019Antoni could try to have his big man \u201cdrop\u201d on pick-and-rolls more frequently rather than switching, but playing drop coverage in the pick-and-roll would require each on-ball defender to play beyond their capabilities. While Paul is an elite defender, Harden, Gordon, and Gerald Green aren\u2019t; teams would run them through screen after screen, which could lead to a whole new set of issues.\n\nHouston switches screens more than any other team because, in theory, it\u2019s what works best for its personnel. Tweaking the defense to switch less could help some, and so could better communication and effort. But schemes can do only so much to make up for a deficient roster. Personnel changes would make the biggest difference. It just won\u2019t be easy for Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to find the pieces that can put the \u201cD\u201d back in D\u2019Antoni.\n\nMultiple reports indicated last week that the Rockets intended to make a move by Friday\u2014the last day a team could acquire a player via trade and retain the ability to combine his salary in another deal before the deadline. That time came and went without Houston making a move. The Rockets (and Pelicans) had interest in Cavaliers wing J.R. Smith, league sources told me last week, but I wouldn\u2019t expect Smith to be high on the priority list now that the aforementioned deadline has passed. Better players should become available as the actual trade deadline on February 7 approaches.\n\nThe Rockets could use help at every position. If Brandon Knight is unable to spell Harden and Paul, I\u2019d look for help from a tanking team like the Hawks, who have point guard Jeremy Lin coming off the bench. The Rockets were once linked to Kent Bazemore, but Bazemore isn\u2019t a playmaker and lacks the necessary bulk to handle what the Rockets will ask of him on switches against bigs closer to the basket. Houston mostly need wings and forwards who bring more size and experience than its current options.\n\nAny additions they make would also have to help patch up the offense. Even though Houston still ranks in the top 10 offensively, its once-dominant pick-and-roll has declined. Last season, the Rockets ranked fourth in pick-and-roll scoring efficiency; now, they rank 16th. The team isn\u2019t drawing as many fouls, they\u2019re turning it over more, and they aren\u2019t shooting 3s nearly as well. For a team that routinely breaks 3-point-shooting records, you\u2019d think they\u2019d have a true knockdown shooter. Harden and Paul are doing their part from deep, given their sheer volume of attempts, but the 3s they shoot aren\u2019t the same as the ones they\u2019re creating for others. Harden has 228 3s off the dribble and only 16 spot-ups, while Paul has 101 and 16, respectively. It\u2019s a shame for Houston that Anthony didn\u2019t work out; he could\u2019ve provided size, shooting, and served as a secondary pick-and-roll threat who could create easier opportunities for Harden and Paul.\n\nThe Rockets are severely undermanned behind Capela, and undersized at the forward spots, which could be problematic if the requirements to make the Finals have changed. The Warriors can throw a curveball this postseason and go big now that they have DeMarcus Cousins. The Rockets are built to go small but they may need to supersize to match up with this Warriors squad.\n\nSome options at forward that come to mind include: James Johnson (Heat), DeMarre Carroll (Nets), and Markieff Morris and Jeff Green (Wizards), players whose teams are on the outside looking in at the playoffs. Johnson and Morris, in particular, could provide muscle on defense while spacing the floor from 3. Bobby Portis (Bulls) makes sense as a player who brings a little extra size, and if the Rockets really want to scrape the bottom of the barrel, they could take a flier on another former Suns lottery pick, Dragan Bender. These names are uninspiring, but it\u2019s hard to find appealing talent that would be feasible for the Rockets to acquire. Ariza will be made available by the Suns, league front office executives expect, but it\u2019s unlikely the Rockets can pursue him without finding a third team for salary-matching purposes. Phoenix can\u2019t trade for Knight because teams aren\u2019t allowed to reacquire a player they traded within one year. Houston will likely have to disregard old flames.\n\nI wonder whether Morey would think about taking a grand risk by exploring a trade for Cavaliers power forward Kevin Love, or even Wizards forward Otto Porter Jr., but both players recently signed massive extensions. While either player could help Houston\u2014Love with scoring, playmaking, and rebounding; Porter with shooting and defending\u2014both players are too expensive to be viable options. Should the Rockets acquire one, the repeater luxury tax implications would be headache-inducing: Harden, Paul, Capela, and the acquisition alone would combine for more than $120 million annually through the 2020-21 season. Building a competitive roster around that would be difficult and pricey. New Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta has expressed reservations about diving into the luxury tax unless the team\u2019s a true contender. \u201cIf you do win the championship, that\u2019s easy money back,\u201d Fertitta said. \u201cNow, if we are in the luxury tax every year and barely getting in the playoffs and a first-round game is a struggle, I\u2019m going to find me a new general manager.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Antoni and Morey feel Fertitta\u2019s pressure. The Rockets have the pieces to be special again, and they\u2019ve shown signs of their high-powered offense during their winning streaks. Harden, for his part, is posting nearly identical numbers to his numbers from last season\u2019s MVP campaign. The Rockets, despite currently occupying the 14-seed, are still only 2.5 games back from the eighth seed in the Western Conference\u2014heck, they\u2019re only six back from the 1-seed. But the team lacks consistency, and its defense hasn\u2019t proved it can get stops. Personnel tweaks are needed to improve their depth, and the current roster must begin simply producing more by hitting more shots, communicating on defense, and playing with the same spirit that powered them before. That might not be enough to go a greater distance than they did last season, but they first need to worry about getting into the playoffs. The Rockets have too much upside built into their system today to worry about tomorrow; they\u2019re locked into maximizing this core.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an insurmountable pit they\u2019ve dug themselves into, though with so much competition in the West, it might look a bit like what Bruce Wayne had to deal with in The Dark Knight Rises. It\u2019s up to Morey to sift through the many imperfect solutions on the table and make some tough calls. If he can\u2019t, the Rockets might just go down as one of the worst teams ever following a 60-plus-win season. And they won\u2019t even need to lose an all-time great to get there.", "keywords": ["houston", "acquire", "season", "switch", "theyll", "flip", "paul", "players", "rockets", "ariza", "team", "harden", "dont", "capela", "teams"], "summary": "The Houston Rockets are owners of the league\u2019s eighth-worst record at 11-14.\nUnlike last season, the Rockets don\u2019t have enough wings who know how to play big.\nThe three-guard lineup of Harden, Paul, and Gordon is playing far more often than it did last season.\nThese names are uninspiring, but it\u2019s hard to find appealing talent that would be feasible for the Rockets to acquire.\nShould the Rockets acquire one, the repeater luxury tax implications would be headache-inducing: Harden, Paul, Capela, and the acquisition alone would combine for more than $120 million annually through the 2020-21 season."}, {"link": "https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-demarcus-cousins-committed-appropriately-deliberate-rehab", "published": "2018-12-11T04:37:11", "title": "Warriors, DeMarcus Cousins committed to appropriately deliberate rehab", "author": [], "text": "OAKLAND -- If it seems like the Warriors are treating DeMarcus Cousins' return with the kind of extra care reserved for a valuable but not yet necessary asset, it's because they are and he is.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr emphasized as much Monday, hours after Cousins worked out with the G League Warriors in Santa Cruz, when he conceded he had not yet talked with Cousins or Santa Cruz coach Aaron Miles.\n\n\u201cI assume it all went well,\u201d Kerr said before the Warriors' game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t, I would have heard by now.\u201d\n\nThe plan, Kerr said, is to take it \u201cday to day\u201d with Cousins. No rush whatsoever.\n\nWhich is as it should be, if not week to week.\n\nThe Warriors didn\u2019t need Cousins for Game 27 last Friday in Milwaukee against the Bucks, and they didn\u2019t need him for Game 28 on Monday against the Timberwolves, either.

Indeed, it\u2019s why he volunteered to go.\n\n\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d Cousins told reporters after his first practice in Santa Cruz. \u201cI wanted to come down. Before I want to step foot on the floor, I wanted to get in some type of basketball rhythm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something me and the trainers kind of butted heads about.

I would be kind of shooting myself in the foot with that.\u201d\n\nFor Cousins, you see, returning to the NBA is as much about pride as contractual obligation. He was an All-Star when he ruptured his left Achilles tendon in January, and he wants to be as close as possible to that level once he\u2019s back in the lineup.\n\nThis is in total accordance with the Warriors, who express not the slightest hint iota of a whisper or a rumor about anything remotely resembling urgency.\n\n\u201cI just want to be in the best shape possible and the best rhythm possible before I actually step on the floor for an NBA game,\u201d Cousins said.\n\n[RELATED: Inside last year's convo with Kerr that changed Draymond's energy]\n\nDr. Rick Celebrini, the Warriors' new director of sports medicine and performance, is the man through whom Cousins has been working. And it will be Celebrini who decides when the big man is physical ready for the demands of an NBA game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming from Rick Celebrini rather than from our doctors,\u201d Kerr said of Cousins\u2019 ongoing rehab. \u201cDeMarcus feels pretty good, and I think the Achilles is healing nicely, but it\u2019s an injury that is unique in that your movement is really affected. Running and moving, when you are dealing with a sprained ankle or knee strain is one thing, but with an Achilles, from what I understand, and I have spoken with Jonas (Jerebko) about as well, it\u2019s just different.

But in their hurry to announce their franchise-altering failure to retain Bryce Harper, they appear to have violated the collective bargaining agreement and pissed off Scott Boras, just the kind of stupid self-injury that would make Bruce Allen proud.\n\nLast week Nationals managing principal owner Mark Lerner went on the radio and told the world that the Nationals\u2019 offer\u2014reportedly 10 years and $300 million\u2014would not be enough for Harper and agent Boras, and that the team \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford to put more than that in\u201d and remain competitive. This is a dumb and self-defeating and self-evidently false thing to say\u2014dumb because no advantage is gained by crying poverty over the airwaves, and false because the Lerner family is insanely rich and can afford another few million bucks a year on top of the $30 million they budgeted for an initial offer. If Bryce is likely to leave for any number of valid reasons beyond the team\u2019s immediate control, that they are too poor to afford him is simply not one of them. But the Nationals stumbled upon another reason why it is inadvisable to run your mouth about contract particulars when no decision has yet been announced\u2014they managed to piss off one of the most powerful agents in sports:\n\nBut Boras has raised concerns with the Nationals about Lerner\u2019s comments violating a more specific rule, one etched in the latest collective bargaining agreement. Attachment 49 states that clubs, players or player representatives may not \u201cdisclose to the media the substance of contract discussions between a player and a Club, (including but not limited to the facts of offers, the substance of offers, or decisions not to make offers or to withdraw offers) until after terms on the contract have been confirmed by the Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association.\u201d\n\nIt seems unlikely that Attachment 49 exists to keep butthead heirs from setting public expectations ahead of the loss of the most important player in team history. But, strictly applied, it has the benefit of keeping offers and negotiating positions private, all the better to support an agent\u2019s efforts to stir up more and better competing offers. Boras reportedly \u201cwas not happy\u201d about Lerner\u2019s comments, and while the Nationals \u201cdo not believe Lerner\u2019s comments violate any of those rules,\u201d they\u2019ve also sent general manager Mike Rizzo out to walk those comments back and limply assert that Washington is still in the hunt:\n\n\n\n\u201cBryce is a terrific guy who I have a great affinity for. He\u2019s been with me a long time and he\u2019s been a part of the real core of the Nationals. But Mark was asked to speculate on the radio station. He speculated, and he shot from his heart and said what he thought. But it\u2019s just speculation. I\u2019m not going to speculate, and I don\u2019t think anyone can speculate until you\u2019re in Harp and Kayla\u2019s head. And maybe they don\u2019t even know where he\u2019s going to end up yet.

This would make it the biggest Nintendo-published game launch in Japan ever, not including the Pok\u00e9mon series. As exciting as this is, it's not as surprising it has likely outpaced existing entries in the Smash franchise, given the ongoing marketing push leading into the game's worldwide release. As for how this compares to other Switch game sales in Japan, it puts it well out in front.\n\nLast month's Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! sold 552,000 copies locally and the month before this Super Mario Party sold 131,000 copies on release. Last year, Splatoon 2 shifted 631,000 copies at launch and Super Mario Odyssey followed this up at the end of the year with 514,000 sales. Ultimate is estimated to shift 10 million in the short-term and is likely to exceed market expectations over the long-term, which will in return improve Nintendo's stock price. More concrete data regarding Japan's Ultimate launch is expected to be revealed soon.\n\nOver in the UK, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate topped the charts in terms of physical sales, and became the fastest-selling Smash game locally of all-time. It even managed to beat the combined sales of Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! domestically. In contrast to existing Smash games in the UK, launch sales for the new game were 302 per cent higher than those achieved by Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 233 per cent higher than Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.

It is Samsung's first smartphone with an Infinity-O display, which has a nearly edge-to-edge, uninterrupted design beyond a small hole for the front-facing camera.It is also Samsung's first smartphone without a headphone jack, much to the amusement of iPhone users, as Samsung has mocked Apple for over two years over its decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 in 2016, a trend that has continued through to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR.While on stage unveiling the new Galaxy Note7 in 2016, for example, Samsung executive Justin Denison made sure to point out that the device came with a headphone jack . \"Want to know what else it comes with?\" he asked. \"An audio jack. I'm just saying,\" he answered, smirking as the audience laughed.And earlier this year, Samsung mocked the iPhone X's lack of a headphone jack in one of its \"Ingenius\" ads promoting the Galaxy S9.In the ad, a customer at an Apple Store asks if he can use his wired headphones with the iPhone X, and the employee informs him that he will need a dongle. The customer then inquires about charging at the same time, and the employee says he'll need another dongle. \"So, a double dongle,\" the customer says.To use wired headphones with the Galaxy A8s, a mid-range device for the Chinese market, users must use a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter.While rumors suggest Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S10 will continue to feature a headphone jack, it could be the company's last flagship handset to have one. In October, Korean website ETNews said Samsung is considering removing the headphone jack from the Galaxy Note10 in 2019 and Galaxy S11 in 2020.Samsung isn't the first tech giant to mock Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack, only to follow suit.

But there\u2019s a pretty decent chance that if we do see a line of Pixel 3 Lite phones in the coming months, they\u2019ll look a lot like these images.\n\nThat means, among other things, that we can expect these phones to be notch-free. While they all have wide aspect ratios (or tall of you\u2019re holding the phone in portrait mode, I guess), there are top and bottom bezels rather than screens that wrap around a camera cut-out.\n\nThe Pixel 3 Lite is expected to have a 5.5 inch display, whiel the Pixel 3 Lite XL will have a 6 inch screen. Both are expected to have FHD+ displays with 18.5:9 aspect ratios.\n\nWhile the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have edge-to-edge glass and stereo speakers, the Lite edition phones have some left and right bezels and single speakers.

Not only does a security key allow for password-free logins to Windows, but can also be used by Microsoft Edge to log you into your Microsoft account.\n\nSign-in Options screen\n\nNew File Explorer icon\n\nWith the release of this build, Microsoft is introducing a new File Explorer icon. Personally, I prefer the original icon over the newer one. According to Microsoft, this new icon is based off of insider's feedback.\n\nDownload folder will be sorted by download date\n\nMicrosoft is changing the default sort for the Download folder to show the newest downloads first. They have stated that they will not change the folder's sort preference if it has previously been changed by the user.\n\nNew context menu to unpin groups and folders from Start Menu\n\nMicrosoft is also rolling out the ability to unpin groups and folders in the Start menu via a new \"Unpin group from start\" context menu.\n\nEngine improvements for the Touch keyboard\n\nWhen you are typing fast on the Touch keyboard, it is common to hit the wrong key by mistake. To eliminate this from happening, Microsoft will now dynamically adjust the size of the hit target for letters in the Touch keyboard based on predictive typing.\n\nFor example, if you were typing cam and the keyboard predicts you are going to type camel, it will make the e's hit target slightly bigger so that you don't mistakenly hit another key. When increasing the size of a key's hit target, it will not look any different to the user.\n\nYou can see an example of the expanded hit targets for certain keys below.\n\nConsole Updates\n\nMicrosoft is testing new settings for the Console that allow you to change the way the cursor looks, different foreground and background colors, different cursor colors, and the blocking of scroll forward in the buffer.\n\nNotepad Improvements\n\nNotepad will now tell you when a document has been changed by prepending an asterisk before the name of the file. Microsoft has also provided an option to save a document as UTF-8 without a BOM (Byte Order Mark) and will save new documents using this encoding by default.\n\nGetting rid of the BOM will provide better compatibility with other programs and the web that do not always expect the BOM in a UTF-8 encoded file.\n\nNarrator Home\n\nWhen enabling Narrator, you will now be brought to the Narrator Home that provides a screen where you access all the settings, features, and guides for Narrator.\n\nEase of Access improvements\n\nMicrosoft has introduced new cursor sizes and colors to make it easier to see the cursor in Windows. This can be accessed by going to Ease of Access Settings (Windows + U), under the \u201cVision\u201d category, and then selecting \u201cCursor & pointer\u201d.\n\nWindows Update notifications\n\nIf an update is installed and requires a reboot, the Power button in the Start Menu will now have a orange indicator in it. This is to alert you that a reboot is necessary to finish the installation.\n\nTo see the entire release notes, you can read the blog post or view them below.\n\nGeneral changes, improvements, and fixes for PC\n\nWe fixed a merge conflict resulting in the Dynamic Lock settings being missing from Sign-in Settings.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in Insiders seeing green screens with error System Service Exception in win32kbase.sys when interacting with certain games and apps in the last two flights.\n\nThe update block for a small number of PCs using Nuvoton (NTC) TPM chips with a specific firmware version (1.3.0.1), due to a bug causing issues with Windows Hello face/biometric/pin login not working, has been removed as this build contains a fix for that issue.\n\nIf you\u2019ve turned off transparency effects, that preference will now also be reflected on the sign-in screen.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in Settings crashing for some Insiders when clicking \u201cCheck for Updates\u201d.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in Settings crashing for some Insiders when going to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in night light settings not working and getting stuck in the last few flights.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in an unexpected amount of space between the categories and subcategories in Settings in recent flights.\n\nWe fixed an issue where the folder size wasn\u2019t calculated correctly in File Explorer\u2019s Properties dialog when there was a path that was longer than MAX_PATH involved.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in menu flyouts appearing blank when using the Arabic display language.\n\nWe fixed an issue where when inking on a PDF in Microsoft Edge, if you erased some ink quickly after starting the inking session, then added more ink, upon saving the PDF not all ink may be saved.\n\nWe fixed an issue where the handwriting panel might crash when using your pen to input into win32 apps in recent builds.\n\nWe fixed an issue resulting in not being able to type into certain tables using the Vietnamese Telex keyboard.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some adjustments when text scaling is enabled to emphasize the icon in the Action Center quick actions so that the text doesn\u2019t overlap.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some improvements so that if theme truncation is detected, we will now handle this more gracefully and not result in unexpectedly thick borders around your windows.\n\nWe\u2019ve made some improvements to reduce the number of times where you might see the error \u201cWindows can\u2019t find one of the files in this theme. Do you still want to save the theme?\u201d appear.\n\nWe\u2019re updating the timeout period when dictating (WIN+H) to be from 5 seconds to 10 seconds, to give you a bit more time to think about what you want to say. If you\u2019d like to stop the dictation before then, just say \u201cStop dictating\u201d or press WIN+H (same as in previous builds).\n\nWe fixed an issue on the touch keyboard resulting in some letters unexpectedly being black instead of white in dark theme.\n\nWe fixed an issue where the \u201c\u2026\u201d menu in clipboard history (WIN+V) was clipped in recent builds.\n\nWe fixed an issue where when displaying the name of a known file type (one registered under HKCR\\ ) File Explorer would display an empty string for the file name in some cases. Now, if a file name is not available, File Explorer will always show the extension name, even if Show File Name Extensions is turned off.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the microphone and camera privacy settings pages to provide information on which apps are currently using the microphone and camera and the date/time apps last accessed your microphone and camera.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Magnifier would not start automatically even when \u201cstart after sign-in setting\u201d for Magnifier was enabled if Narrator was not set to auto start after sign-in.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Magnifier did not work with Touch when Centered mouse mode was enabled.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Narrator sometimes would not start after completing Out of Box Experience (OOBE).\n\nWe fixed the issue causing Narrator to start unexpectedly. We also made it easier to turn off Narrator when it was launched unintentionally.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Narrator scan mode did not turn off automatically when you focused the address bar in Microsoft Edge.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Narrator heading navigation was skipping some headings in Chrome.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Narrator read page loaded notification multiple times in Chrome.\n\nWe fixed an issue where Narrator did not read Edit box placeholder text in Chrome.\n\nWe fixed an issue that caused the settings page to crash after changing the account password or PIN.\n\nKnown issues\n\nThe hyperlink colors need to be refined in Dark Mode in Sticky Notes if the Insights are enabled.\n\nSettings crashes when clicking on the \u201cView storage usage on other drives\u201d option under System > Storage.\n\nThe Windows Security app may show an unknown status for the Virus & threat protection area, or not refresh properly. This may occur after upgrade, restart, or settings changes.\n\nDelete previous version of Windows in Configure Storage Sense is not selectable.\n\nSettings will crash when opening Speech Settings.\n\nThe cmimanageworker.exe process may hang, causing system slowness or higher than normal CPU usage. This can be bypassed by rebooting the machine if it occurs.\n\nLaunching games that use BattlEye anti-cheat will trigger a bug check (green screen) \u2013 we\u2019re investigating.\n\nUSB printers may appear twice in the Devices and Printers under Control Panel.

GizmoChina reports:\n\nFor Japan Display, around 80 percent of its overall revenue is generated through the production of the display panel for smartphones. [The] majority of those earning is dependent on its business with Apple. Earlier, the company, known as JDI, has reported sales forecast growth in the range of 10 percent to 20 percent.

Starting today, Alexa users can now access new features including location-based routines and reminders, timer enhancements, app notifications, email support, and more. These features were originally announced back in September, but are now making their way to users.\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nAs reported by TechCrunch, Alexa support for location means that you can now create routines and reminders that trigger based on your whereabouts. For instance, you could say, \u201cAlexa, remind me to feed the dogs when I get home.\u201d Then, when you arrive home, based on the location of your phone, Alexa will voice the reminder to you.\n\nAnother possibility is something like, \u201cAlexa, remind me to print the report when I get to the office.\u201d In this instance, if you don\u2019t have an Alexa-enabled device at your office, the Alexa app on your phone will send you a push notification with the reminder.\n\nAs for location-based routines, they can now be triggered based on your arrival or departure of a location. For instance, your \u201cafter work\u201d routine could immediately begin when you arrive at home. Locations, such as work and home, can be saved in the Alexa app for use in routines and reminders.\n\nIn addition to the new location capabilities, routines are adding several other new features. First, you can now add \u201cwait actions\u201d to routines. This means your \u201cgood morning\u201d routine could immediately turn on the lights, but wait 20 minutes before playing the news or music. Routines can also now stop audio from playing and enable Alexa\u2019s Do Not Disturb functionality.\n\nLastly, routines can now integrate with push notifications and Announcements. For example, your \u201cDinner Time\u201d routine could send an Announcement to other users that dinner is ready. Additionally, push notification support means that a routine can send a notification, such as \u201cI\u2019m on the way home\u201d to another user.\n\nElsewhere, timer support is being updated with the options to add and remove time. Further, location support is being added to Alexa queries such as \u201cAlexa, where is the nearest Starbucks?\u201d This means your Alexa device will automatically search around your current location for its answer.\n\nLast but not least, Alexa has added support for email. With this, you can ask your Alexa device to read your latest emails by simply saying, \u201cAlexa, check my email\u201d or \u201cAlexa, do I have any emails from Zac?\u201d\n\nAll of these new features are rolling out today in the United States, but Amazon notes the rollout process will take several weeks.

A quarter of century after its release, the game\u2019s legacy is unquestionable \u2014 but it could always use a few new levels. So co-creator John Romero made some. They come with a silver statue of his head impaled on a spike.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot one can say at Doom\u2019s 25th anniversary that one couldn\u2019t at its 20th, so I\u2019ll spare you the big retrospective. Suffice it to say that Doom still rules, and if you\u2019ve never played it, you\u2019ve got a treat ahead of you. And at this point there\u2019s enough of it to rival modern games in length and challenge.\n\nWhat has happened in the intervening five years is the release of\u2026 well, Doom, AKA Doom 2016. This gory, kinetic remake charmed (and tore out) the hearts of millions, reigniting interest in a franchise that had seen better days.\n\nSeeing this renewed interest, and with the 25th anniversary, approaching, co-creator John Romero decided he wanted to dive back into making maps for the game that made him.\n\n\u201cI worked on it part time during 2017 and 2018, mostly while I was on vacation or in the evenings,\u201d Romero explained in an interview, apparently with himself, posted on his website. \u201cFor me, making this whole episode was a labor of love and a reminder of all the amazing times that we had at id working on the original. I was fortunate to be a part of such a great team and a foundational game.\u201d\n\nSigil is a pack of nine levels that are an unofficial, but probably as official as we\u2019re likely to get, fifth \u201cepisode\u201d of Doom.\n\n\u201cI wanted the levels to feel like they belong to the original game as if they were a true fifth episode,\u201d Romero told himself. \u201cThere\u2019s more detail in the levels than episodes 1-4, but not overly so. The boss level is terrifying. There\u2019s a massive room in E5M6 that is the coolest room I\u2019ve created in any map.\u201d\n\nMany will remember the synth-metal soundtrack to the original, and to match that Romero tapped legendary metal guitarist Buckethead to contribute a song to Sigil. The catch is that the song doesn\u2019t come with the free version of the expansion.\n\nSee, Sigil will release as a megawad \u2014 a wad of .wad (\u201cwhere\u2019s all the data?\u201d) files, the original format for Doom expansions and mods. You\u2019ll be able to download that for free and play it on your original copy of Doom; if you don\u2019t have one, you can buy one for $5, and should.\n\nBut true Doom megafans will want to go with a boxed edition. The standard one comes with a 3.5\u2033 floppy disk-shaped USB drive with the game on it, but the \u201cBeast Box\u201d has a bunch of extra gear inside the giant box: a booklet and print, an XL Sigil shirt and, most tempting of all, \u201ca pewter statue of John Romero\u2019s head on a spike.\u201d This is a reference to a famous Doom Easter egg, but honestly would have made perfect sense anyway.\n\n\u201cI believe the most important legacy of Doom is its community, the people who have kept it alive for 25 years through the creation of mods and tools,\u201d said Romero. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all lost on me that I have gone from a creator to a part of the community in that space of time, and I love that.\u201d\n\nSigil comes out mid-February. I can\u2019t wait. If you\u2019re interested in the more modern Doom stuff, though, keep an eye out for Doom Eternal, the sequel to the 2016 hit. More of the same? Sounds good to me.

That was the same job held by Adam Mosseri, who currently runs Instagram, until he was promoted following the departure of the company\u2019s two co-founders this fall.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson confirmed the promotion and sent Recode the following statement from Mosseri:\n\nI am thrilled that Vishal Shah is Instagram\u2019s new Head of Product. Vishal is an experienced manager with deep product knowledge who lives out Instagram\u2019s values of people first, simplicity, and craft. He is a great addition to our leadership team and I look forward to working with him in this new role.\n\nIt\u2019s been a quietly tumultuous year for Instagram leadership \u2014 quiet because Instagram\u2019s executive changes have been overshadowed by its parent company Facebook, which has some kind of public crisis virtually every week.\n\nInstagram\u2019s heads of product and engineering left for a newly formed Facebook blockchain team in May, its COO took a promotion at Facebook in September and its co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, left abruptly later that month. Mosseri, who was promoted to run all of Instagram two months ago, has been looking to fill open head of product, head of engineering and COO roles just six months after joining Instagram himself.\n\nShah\u2019s promotion takes care of at least one of those openings \u2014 an important one made all the more important by Systrom\u2019s departure. As Instagram\u2019s co-founder and a detail-obsessed designer, Systrom was very hands-on with the app. He famously approved every single Instagram ad when the company first started selling them. Systrom\u2019s departure led to some concern externally that the Instagram app could get messed up in the wrong hands.\n\nFacebook can\u2019t let that happen considering Instagram has become arguably the company\u2019s most important product. The photo- and video-sharing app will soon account for a sizable part of Facebook\u2019s revenue growth, and also drives users back to the main Facebook app. Plus, it keeps Facebook connected to younger people online, and has helped the company fend off a potential threat in Snapchat.\n\nThe task of continuing Instagram\u2019s momentum will fall largely on the company\u2019s new executive leaders, including Shah. It could be tough. Facebook is dealing with some serious morale issues following the company\u2019s public missteps, including an increase in employees thinking about leaving.

Ultimate's many fighters", "author": [], "text": "You can go about it a few different ways\n\nSo here's the thing about Super Smash Bros. Ultimate -- you only start with a handful of fighters! Yep I know, it sounds rough, but in the grand scheme of things you'll have plenty of time to experiment with the entire roster after spending a day (or less) getting them.\n\nThere's a few ways you can go about it.\n\nThe old fashioned grind\n\nEvery single fighter in Smash can be unlocked in its standard mode over time. The quickest way to grab them all is to just create a one stock bout and go at it with a friend: or, less eloquently, against a CPU and just sacrifice yourself.\n\nNote that there's a timer on when fighters can be unlocked. You can try to circumvent this by resetting the game entirely, or by legitimately playing through a ton of quick versus games. The choice is yours.\n\nJust know that you still have to fight and beat incoming new characters to unlock them. If you lose, you'll get the chance to challenge them again from a main menu option after a short period of time (roughly 10 minutes).\n\nThrough the campaign (my suggestion)\n\nIf you're the primary Smash player in the house and are going to immediately jump into a solo mode, you'll want to unlock fighters by way of World of Light.\n\nThe thing, you're able to unlock characters double-time by playing the World of Light campaign. Fighters will appear as encased blue emanating trophies on the world map: if you defeat them you'll unlock them game-wide. Also, World of Light runs on a counter similar to the old-fashioned away above. By backing out of the mode entirely (out of the save file screen too) you'll periodically trigger another roster unlocking encounter.\n\nIt took me approximately 15 hours to finish World of Light with some exploration of ancillary areas, but I had everyone unlocked around 10 hours into that save file. If you back out enough you can do it considerably quicker in a non-mindless fashion.\n\nThe Classic way\n\nClassic Mode unlocks specific characters after completion depending on who you queued up Classic with.\n\nEach Classic run should take around 10 minutes, roughly the amount of time the unlock timer is for fighters (if you don't reset). If you're not into World of Light you can go this route but it's considerably slower than anything else.\n\nYou are logged out.

Douglas was an engineer at Stanford Research Institute, who had put up a computer conference in San Francisco to showcase several evolutionary technologies.\n\nThe demo is known to be the computer industry\u2019s then futuristic conference till date. The demo is also considered to be one of a kind because engineer Douglas has shown profuse technologies on the stage that included \u2013 word processing, hyper-texting, video conferencing, multiple windows, graphics on a desktop, editing, real-time computer collaboration and the predominant \u2018mouse,\u2019 all-in-all in 1968.\n\nEngelbart\u2019s focus was on the human-computer interaction, especially at his Augmentation Research Center, which resulted in the invention of the computer mouse. Despite his genius ideas that are being taken for granted in today\u2019s era, his name is still known little in this modern society. For instance, Windows, Skype, FaceTime, or Google Docs, which are currently the effective services recognized globally are built on the idea of Engelbart visionary ideas.\n\n50 years ago today, a brilliant scientist, Doug Engelbart, gave the #MotherOfAllDemos and showed the world the first computer mouse!

This was presumably Douglas\u2019 first public demonstration witnessing all these essential items on a single system. Douglas along with his engineering team has conducted this innovative demonstration at his Augmentation Research Centre at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). A 1,000 number of computer professionals also witnessed the presentation on that stage, that day.\n\nApart from the word processing, hyper-texting, the innovations like video conferencing and the interactive mouse looked futuristic back then. While the video conferencing is the modern era\u2019s Skype, the mouse has also become a significant invention in contemporary society.\n\nDuring the presentation in 1968, Douglas had showcased the prototype mouse on the stage alongside the keyboard, which looked a big chunk of a wooden box in hand. However, before 1965, Douglas had developed a mouse with his lead engineer Bill English, for which, the patent was received in 1970. The patent was then described as an \u2018X-Y position indicator for a display system.\u2019 Ironically \u2018mouse\u2019 was a nickname to the X-Y position indicator. Even though, the SRI had patented the \u2018mouse\u2019 they hadn\u2019t known the value of it until it was licensed to Apple Computer for around $40,000.\n\nWell, celebrating the 50 years of \u201cMother of all demos\u201d that resulted in creation of computer mouse, a well-known Computer mouse, and personal computing peripheral manufacturer, Logitech says \u2013 having been fortunate to host the Engelbart foundation from 1992-2007 and experience his immense vision firsthand, Logitech has collaborated with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, to help showcase this Silicon Valley hero, while looking ahead to the next 50 years of technology and human empowerment.\n\nLogitech, a Swiss company, has started its journey with their introduction of mice for computers in 1981 that provided an intuitive way of interacting with your personal computer.

Which is why Walmart is offering steep discounts on the only Google Home products you really need.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to save big on Google Home devices before the holiday deals come to an end, there\u2019s no better time than right now. These starter bundles work great as Christmas gifts for parents, or pretty much anyone looking to get their smart home started \u2014 with the added benefit of being gentle on your wallet.\n\nThis smart home bundle is for those who love to stream. For under $50, you get a Google Home Mini (comparable to the Echo Dot) and a Chromecast. These two items combined will allow you to stream your favorite shows, browse Netflix, or navigate Hulu with ease. You will also get full access to Google Smart Assistant for pretty much everything else. Though the Google Home Mini is small, it still works great as a Bluetooth speaker and can answer just about any question you could think of.\n\nNormally priced at $74 when you purchase the items separately, this Google Home bundle is down to just $49 for a limited time.\n\nBuy Now\n\nThis slightly more affordable smart home bundle is for anyone only looking for some minor integration within their home.

Just like the coupe, the roofless McLaren 720S packs 710 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque, and will rocket to 60 miles per hour in a claimed 2.8 seconds.\n\nThe 720S Spider is built around what McLaren calls the Monocage II-S carbon-fiber tub, a variant of the Monocage II tub used for the 720S coupe. All told, the Spider is only 108 pounds -- or just under 4 percent -- heavier than the coupe. With such little weight gain, McLaren says that the 720S Spider's quarter-mile time is only one-tenth of a second slower than the coupe's, at a brisk 10.4 seconds.\n\nMcLaren\n\nAs in the 720S coupe, power for the Spider comes from McLaren's twin-turbo, 4.0-liter V8, with a seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission sending power to the rear wheels. The car also boasts carbon-ceramic brakes, Pirelli P-Zero tires and adaptive suspension.\n\nThe McLaren 720S Spider does not look dramatically different from the coupe with the roof closed. The power-retracting roof can be lowered in just 11 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. (The 650S Spider, by contrast, needed 17 seconds to operate the roof and doing so could only be accomplished at up to 18.5 mph.) McLaren says it has registered three patents on the roof mechanism. An optional electrochromic glass roof panel can alternate between tinted and transparent at the touch of a button.\n\nTop speed with the roof up is 212 mph, matching the 720S Coupe, while with the roof open the 720S Spider can manage 202 mph.\n\nThe automaker says that a new design for the window and the tonneau cover improve rear and over-the-shoulder visibility compared to prior McLaren convertibles, too. The active rear spoiler automatically adjusts its behavior to compensate for how the car's aerodynamics change when the roof is open versus closed.\n\nOrder books for the McLaren 720S are open now, with the first deliveries scheduled for March 2019.

Various test vehicles have been spied in public for over two years, with the most recent sighting having occurred just last Friday featuring a fearsome-sounding race version testing in the dark at Sebring. Today, our friends over at MidEngineCorvetteForum.com have another morsel to offer us, taking the form of the rendered 360-degree video above.\n\nThe video is the handiwork of forum member Chazcron, and if it seems familiar, you\u2019re not wrong. A couple weeks ago Chazcron dropped a similar 360-degree rendered video that interpreted the various body lines and scoops of Chevrolet\u2019s forthcoming supercar, but left details to the imagination. Those details are now filled in, including the tail lights and a better look at the engine cover based on the patent application recently discovered. There\u2019s still plenty of interpretation and creative license used in this render, but with a bevy of spy photos showing the real-life car from pretty much every angle, this could well be an accurate depiction of the new Corvette.\n\n6 Photos\n\nThis video also differs from the previous version in that it takes us up-and-over as well as around the car. The sculpting on the roof and hood is clearer, and the swooping rear pillars also take on new significance. The video also includes a pair of lower LED strip lights in the air intakes up front, something we haven\u2019t seen on camouflaged prototypes per se, though we have seen a larger fin in that region that could support such a light.\n\nThe biggest Corvette leak so far? Mid-Engined Corvette 'Insider' Claims To Have Full C8 Story\n\nThis rendering comes just days after an alleged insider shared a story outlining the mid-engined Corvette\u2019s future. The story is linked above, but the gist is that the first model will be an LT1-powered \u201centry level\u201d C8 called Manta Ray, followed by a GT version and a Grand Sport that, according to the storyteller, is so powerful that it prompted Chevrolet to bring in a team of lawyers for legal advice. That seems a bit silly to us, but other parts \u2013 like Chevrolet creating a Corvette brand with special sales requirements for dealerships \u2013 could be legit.\n\nTo Chevrolet\u2019s credit, mid-engined Corvette details have been kept well under wraps. The only info we have is through alleged leaks; even our normal group of sources are coming up empty on \u201cunofficial\u201d information. We do, however, expect our wait is almost over.

Despite being short and sweet, a lot of info was packed into the trailer, which we've broken down here for easy consumption.\n\nNew Chapter and New Characters\n\nThe trailer opened with the announcement of Book III, the next chapter in the Fire Emblem Heroes story and along with it, four new characters. Eir and Hel the princess and Queen of the Realm of the Dead were shown as well as two of their generals: Lif and Thrasir. Upon clearing Chapter 1 of Book III, you'll receive a 5* version of Eir.\n\nToday's Update\n\nStarting later today, the 3.0 update to Fire Emblem Heroes launches. Once yiou've downloaded the update, here's what you can expect to see:\n\nNew Seasons: Four new season will be added to Fire Emblem Heroes: Light, Dark, Astra and Anima. These four season join the originals: Fire, Water, Wind and Earth. Also introduced was a new hero rarity: Mythic. The new seasons will grant bonuses to the new Mythic Heroes.\n\nNew Summoning Event: A new summoning event launches tonight, with the beginning of a Hero Fest, but some important changes have been made to summoning, which we'll talk about in a moment. The featured heroes for this event are Owain, Lewyn, Ophelia and the newly-announced character, Eir.\n\nAlso announced in the trailer was a new ticket type, called a First Summon Ticket. By using a First Summon Ticket, you can get your first summon without spending any orbs. Any subsequent summons in that session will require you shell out as usual.\n\nFinally, Nintendo dropped details on January's Event, Forging Bonds. The event will give out First Summon Tickets as rewards, and will feature heroes from Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn As part of this preview, we got a sneak peek at Tibarn. Tibarn is a new unit type that can transform into a beast during battle, which should add some variety to the game.\n\nFire Emblem Heroes is still going strong nearly two years after its release.

How bad trolling is in Red Dead Online\u2019s free roam is hard to say, with many different opinions and stories being currently shared in the community. Whether or not griefing is a widespread problem, many players who\u2019ve experienced it have suggestions for what could be improved.\n\nMy personal experience with other players in Red Dead Online has been almost entirely positive. I\u2019ve only been killed maybe four times for no reason. I\u2019ve never been lassoed while fishing or attacked while doing a side mission. Some of my friends have had similarly peaceful experiences. This has made the game more enjoyable than GTA Online, with its kill-happy trolls. In fact, I barely even worry about other RDO players. Most wave at me as I ride by or even fish next to me if they see me.\n\nOther RDO players are reporting similar experiences and sharing stories of only shooting other players if they attack first. One player says they met random folks in saloons and had a drink together, then set up a mock fight club. Another player shared a story of running into a posse calling itself \u201cThe Lancaster Bandits,\u201d and after his horse died they gave it a 21 gun salute. Some of my favorite stories of friendly players helping each other are the moments when someone falls off a cliff or a waterfall and nearby helpful players use their lasso skills to save the day.\n\nWhile many players, including myself, are enjoying a Red Dead Online experience that is mostly peaceful and chill, other players aren\u2019t so lucky. One friend of mine had a completely different first few minutes with RDO than I had. He was lassoed and killed multiple times the moment he left the tutorial and entered Blackwater. He ended up leaving that session and joining mine, where he was left alone. On Reddit, the GTA Forums and Twitter, players are sharing similar stories of griefers.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF GIF: YouTube\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayers have different theories as to why some folks are finding trolls in Red Dead Online while others are meeting nice cowpokes who only want to wave and whistle. One theory is that different platforms have different communities, with some wondering if the Xbox One player base is the nicest. Others wonder if more players joining the beta means more trolls. I think it has more to do with luck than anything else. Some players might just be getting unlucky and placed in sessions with less friendly players. But regardless of the scope of the problem, there are certainly some players who are having very negative experiences in the game, and some players have ideas about how to fix it.\n\n\n\nOne request from the community has been the removal of player dots on the map. Many players believe that always having others marked on the map makes it easier for other players to hunt them down. Another feature many fans are asking for is private sessions. GTA Online had private sessions, which allow players to mess around in free roam without being interrupted or trolled by strangers. But GTA Online limited what players could do in private sessions, such as not allowing players to start business or CEO missions. It is unclear if similar restrictions would be placed on Red Dead Online private servers if they are implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany players want a passive mode, like the one in GTA Online, to be added into RDO. Passive mode in GTA Online let players become immune to damage from others, but it also disabled guns and explosives. While passive mode prevented some griefing, players could still troll others by killing them repeatedly and then going passive so the victim had no way to retaliate. Others feel that Red Dead Online is supposed to be the wild west and some danger around other players needs to exist.\n\nI would love to see a bounty feature added into Red Dead Online, like the one suggested by Reddit user LuckyDucky636 that would put a price on players who killed others. This would allow players to still freely attack and kill random players, while also giving players a way to fight back against griefers and maybe make some cash too. It could be interesting to see a system that allowed players to capture their bounties alive and bring them back to a jail cell, similar to Sea of Thieves\u2019 brig.\n\nWhile players have suggestions, they aren\u2019t waiting on Rockstar to fix the problems with griefing. Many Red Dead Online fans are asking friendly players to whistle when they see each other, hoping to make it easier to quickly figure out who is a friend or foe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGTA Online never really fixed its griefing problem; in fact, many would argue it got worse as the game added more powerful vehicles. Hopefully Rockstar won\u2019t repeat history with RDO. We know Rockstar has a few updates already planned for Red Dead Online, and certainly things will change over time. Hopefully future updates will lessen the frustration some players are feeling after dying to trolls or give players more ways to combat them.", "keywords": ["griefing", "split", "gta", "different", "dead", "red", "players", "trolls", "rdo", "similar", "online", "sessions"], "summary": "Red Dead Online is a slower and more relaxed game than GTA Online, but that doesn\u2019t mean griefers and trolls haven\u2019t found ways to ruin players\u2019 days.\nMy personal experience with other players in Red Dead Online has been almost entirely positive.\nWhile many players, including myself, are enjoying a Red Dead Online experience that is mostly peaceful and chill, other players aren\u2019t so lucky.\nOthers feel that Red Dead Online is supposed to be the wild west and some danger around other players needs to exist.\nWe know Rockstar has a few updates already planned for Red Dead Online, and certainly things will change over time."}, {"link": "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-11-beta-launching-in-march-2019/1100-6463800/", "published": "2018-12-10T17:51:00", "title": "Mortal Kombat 11 Beta Launching In March 2019", "author": ["Steve Watts"], "text": "Mortal Kombat 11 was announced at the Game Awards, and it's already just around the corner with an April 23, 2019 release date.

Well, no, it\u2019s just the Germans trying to be cute.\n\n\n\nAt the global first drive event for the new 3 Series in Portugal last week, BMW offered a brief design presentation to explain the inspiration for the new body style of the G20 3 Series\u2014a design which really grows on you after a couple of days seeing it in person, by the way.\n\nIn that presentation, the audience of bored faces all awoke at the mention of the new car\u2019s headlight notch being inspired by everybody\u2019s first or second favorite 3 Series, the E46.\n\nEvidently, the vertical line stretching up from the bulky black radar emitter and leading into a shark-fin shaped intrusion on the headlight is meant to evoke the lower shape of the old E46 headlights, specifically the beams of the facelifted 2001 car, which had a pointed curve jutting up into the headlight, too. Take a look:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook at that. Those sure are similar, now that it\u2019s been specifically brought to my attention, but I definitely missed the point at first (ha ha).\n\nDid this little bit of designer inspiration change my opinion of the new car\u2019s design? Not really, but I will say that having driven it around for a few days photographing it for tomorrow\u2019s first impressions post, I have warmed up to the new look of the 330i quite a bit. Even the rear-end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow knowing what you know, how do you feel about the notch? Would you feel better about it if it also had a headlight washer function like the old one? Is this a good nod to the past? Does the notch mean the G20 also drives like the old E46? Find out tomorrow!\n\nThat\u2019s because our first drive review drops tomorrow! So you gotta wait, like, a day! Just a day!\n\nWait.\n\n(At least they didn\u2019t try to go for the 325ti look again:)", "keywords": ["series", "bmw", "e46", "actually", "headlight", "look", "design", "nod", "old", "weird", "presentation", "really", "iconic", "specifically", "2019", "notch"], "summary": "The world fell to silence on October 2 when BMW revealed the first awkward press photos of the seventh-generation 2019 BMW 3 Series.\nWhy does the front have a weird notch in the headlights?\nIn that presentation, the audience of bored faces all awoke at the mention of the new car\u2019s headlight notch being inspired by everybody\u2019s first or second favorite 3 Series, the E46.\nWould you feel better about it if it also had a headlight washer function like the old one?\nDoes the notch mean the G20 also drives like the old E46?"}, {"link": "https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2019-porsche-macan-s-drive", "published": "2018-12-11T00:05:13", "title": "The Brilliant-Driving 2019 Porsche Macan Is Barely Changed, and That's Okay", "author": [], "text": "Crouched and Ready to Pounce\n\nAnd the Macan does invite hard cornering, more than almost any other SUV.

It will be exclusive to Epic\u2019s store until Early Access is complete, for \u201cat least a year and a half,\u201d the game\u2019s creative director Greg Kasavin told Kotaku. Hades will likely come to Steam after that, he said.\n\n\n\nGoat Simulator developerCoffee Stain Studios\u2019 next game, Satisfactory, will also be launching exclusively on Epic\u2019s store. Coffee Stain went so far as to take down Satisfactory\u2019s Steam page, something that did not sit will with fans.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people are gonna have strong opinions on that,\u201d said community manager Jace Varley in a video. \u201cCool. Have those opinions.\u201d Varley said that he understands the decision to use only the Epic store isn\u2019t necessarily going to make everyone happy and said it was \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d to not be able to tell people sooner.\n\n\n\nThe very cool-looking cowboy space shooter Rebel Galaxy Outlaw will also be exclusive to the Epic Games store for a year. \u201cAchieving Epic\u2019s goals on the royalty front means more developers succeeding and surviving and making more good stuff,\u201d wrote the game\u2019s developers in an FAQ.\n\n\n\nFirst-person roguelite ship builder Genesis Alpha One will be exclusive to the Epic store for an undisclosed period of time, and a planned \u201cplayable preview\u201d that was to come to Steam has been shelved, for now at least. Developer Team 17 was conciliatory to an audience frustrated by the sudden change of plans. \u201cWe understand this might be disappointing, and this was a tough decision to make but we believe this will help Genesis Alpha One get off to the best possible start,\u201d it wrote in a Steam post.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, some fans aren\u2019t taking these announcements incredibly well, given that Steam has been their one-stop PC gaming shop for years, and they\u2019ve got communities and libraries of hundreds of un-played sale games there. But sudden change is messy and difficult\u2014especially when it\u2019s kept under lock and key by a bunch of NDAs ahead of an award show announcement.

And during that time, we generate more engagement than...whether it's CES or Comic-Con, or other big entertainment events,\u201d Fils-Aime told IGN. \u201cPeople tune in to find out what's new and to have first playable experiences for our industry. That's why E3 is important to Nintendo.\u201d\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nStill, Fils-Aime emphasized that just showing up isn\u2019t enough, and that Nintendo has changed its approach each year to match the games it\u2019s currently highlighting.\n\n\u201c For us it's a very effective opportunity to deliver our message, and therefore it's a bit of a no-brainer for us to participate.\n\n\u201cOur mentality has been to constantly innovate what we do and how we message at E3,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've innovated in how we utilize our booth space, to create a little piece of Hyrule or to create a little piece of the environment in Super Mario Odyssey, as examples. We innovate in how we deliver our messaging, whether it was the big stage productions or whether it's the Direct communications that we do today.\n\n\u201cAnd so everyone's watching, we drive innovation, we leverage the elements, so for us it's a very effective opportunity to deliver our message, and therefore it's a bit of a no-brainer for us to participate. Now, what's important as an industry, though, is that E3 in total continues to innovate and it continues to be that leading opportunity to drive consumer engagement in this way. So that's why we participate. That's why I sit on the board of the ESA and help drive some of this thinking. It's important to us.\u201d\n\nAs for what Nintendo shows during the event, Fils-Aime said it\u2019s a balancing act between games that will be released soon and those that are further away. Often the latter will be used to reassure fans that more traditional experiences are on the way, such as the core Pokemon RPG reemphasized alongside the announcement of Pokemon: Let\u2019s Go, or a mainline Fire Emblem game (which later became Fire Emblem: Three Houses) announced alongside Fire Emblem Warriors.\n\nE3 2016: Nintendo's Zelda: Breath of the Wild Booth Images 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 19 01 OF 19 E3 2016: Nintendo's Zelda: Breath of the Wild Booth Images Download Image Captions ESC\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, we like to talk about games that are closer. Typically, for example, at E3, we'll focus on content maybe extending into the first or second calendar quarter following E3. That is typically our horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that works because it's close enough that the fans can be excited and look forward to it. And when we do have an exception and do something different, we're doing it for very specific reasons.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have two experiences within a particular franchise, and we know that one might be maybe a nontraditional representation of that franchise. Or maybe then it's important for us to frame that the more traditional visualization of that franchise is coming. \u2018Fans, don't worry, but here's something different to tide you over in the meantime.\u2019 So that's how we think about it, and how we approach our consumer communication. We want to be near-end. We want to deliver news when it's most meaningful. We don't want to be so far out that the consumer either loses interest, or worse, gets frustrated.\u201d\n\nFor more from our interview with Fils-Aime, read why Persona 5\u2019s Joker is emblematic of future Smash Bros.

Some experts in Great Britain have weighed in and Keri Lumm shares some of their findings.

So what can parents do?\n\nIt's also costing kids sleep, decent grades and a normal life, the story said.

Find seven no dancing signs and do the forbidden: dance! We went back to our old map and checked, but only two locations still exist in the current Fortnite map. Those two include the one near the metal llama and the hill northwest of Wailing Woods.\n\nHere is a lit of all 12 locations. Remember, you only have to dance in front of seven of them!\n\nJunk Junction - At the base of the metal llama.\n\n- At the base of the metal llama. South of Risky Reels on the small hill with the RV.\n\non the small hill with the RV. Dusty Divot - Near the zipline on the northeast edge of the crater.\n\n- Near the zipline on the northeast edge of the crater. At the race track in the desert along the back wall of the taco shop.\n\nNorth of Wailing Woods at the ice cream truck on the small hill.\n\nat the ice cream truck on the small hill. At the top of Stunt Mountain, north of the soccer stadium.\n\nOn the very edge of the pointed section of the snow biome, south of Frosty Flights .\n\n. Southeast of Frost Flights on a small hill with a campfire.\n\non a small hill with a campfire. Loot Lake - On top of the giant rock on the east side.\n\n- On top of the giant rock on the east side. South of Paradise Palms on top of a mountain with three cacti.\n\non top of a mountain with three cacti. Southwest of Dusty Divot near the top of the irregular mountain.\n\nnear the top of the irregular mountain. Lazy Links - On the dock over the pond.\n\nEditPick up an item of each rarity\n\nSimply pick up at least one of each type of item rarity. For those unfamiliar, here are the five weapon types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon\n\nUncommon\n\nRare\n\nEpic\n\nLegendary\n\n\n\nEditPlay matches with at least one elimination\n\nPlay five different matches where you score at least one elimination. If you're having trouble getting an elimination, try playing squads or duos where you have teammates to help you. On the other hand, taking someone out in solos will eliminate them immediately rather than knocking them out. It's unclear if the Team Rumble LTM will count towards this goal.\n\nEditBattle Pass Challenges\n\nEditStage 1: Dance on Top of a Crown of RV's\n\nA multi-stage challenge where dancing at different locations moves you to the next step. Keep in mind you have to visit the areas in different matches. The three stages are:\n\nStage 1: Dance on Top of a Crown of RV's\n\nStage 2: Dance on top of a metal turtle\n\nStage 3: Dance on top of a submarine\n\nYou can find the first part of this challenge on top of hill in the desert biome. This hill is south of the small adobe town near the gas station. Dance anywhere within the ring of cars to make it count!\n\nThe metal turtle is situated east of Wailing Woods. Look for the big metal turtle hanging out near the edge of the map. Make sure to dance on top!\n\nFinally, the last location is on top of a frozen submarine in the new snowy terrain. Head over to quadrant B9 and look for the submarine at the top of hill. You're better off landing here from the battle bus rather than trying to build up!\n\nEditDeal Headshot Damage to opponents\n\nDeal 500 damage through headshots. Considering headshots typically double the damage, reaching 500 total damage shouldn't take too long. Obviously, aim for the head to make it happen, but certain weapons could make this easier. Using shotguns when you're up close can make it a lot less of a chore. Be above an enemy to increase your chances as the head hitbox will be on top of their body hitbox. While you're sniping, take bullet drop into account and aim higher the further you are.\n\nEditStage 1: Search Ammo Boxes in a single match\n\nA second multi-stage challenge involving opening containers. The full list:\n\nStage 1: Search Ammo Boxes in a single match\n\nStage 2: Search Three Chests in a single match\n\nStage 3: Search One Supply Drop in a single match\n\nEditEliminate opponents in different Named Locations\n\nHead over to any of the 21 named locations and take out an enemy. Do this for five different locationsto complete the challenge. Sadly, a number of previous locations were removed in Season 7 but we also get a few brand new ones! Rest in peace Greasy Grove and Flush Factory.

Impulse game buyer that I am, I snapped up both Supergiant\u2019s Hades (because duh) and A44\u2019s stylish but mysterious RPG, Ashen. Let me tell you, I\u2019m glad I did.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nAshen tells the story of three races and a godlike creature above them all, The Ashen, who disappeared and thrust the world into darkness and despair. But it\u2019s now aware and, your task as the hero is to find the Ashen and push away the darkness forever, before something more sinister or vile does in your stead.\n\nThe basics of Ashen will immediately make players think of Dark Souls - dodge-based combat, weapons and locked animations with stamina as a resource for everything. Collecting \u201cScoria\u201d as a currency to use to level weapons and items. But the more I play Ashen, the more I think of it as a Zelda-like, rather than \u201cyet another Souls game\u201d.\n\nIts massive open world, chatty NPCs, and evolving hometown of Vagrant\u2019s Rest gives Ashen a lot more heart than any Souls game or Bloodborne have ever had. What\u2019s more is that as you find companions throughout the world, you\u2019ll invite them back to Vagrant\u2019s Rest, to help rebuild civilization, and they\u2019ll often join you out on your adventures in the wild. They bring their own weapons and often selflessly attack foes that are about to chop you down. In this way, it becomes easier than Dark Souls, but make no mistake - this can still be a hard game, especially in the puzzle-like boss fights.\n\nAll progression is achieved through finishing the game\u2019s many main and side quests, sometimes rewarding you with new gear, new loadouts that change your character\u2019s stats, or new abilities in camps where you can use Scoria to increase the effectiveness of your weapons and armor. You\u2019ll almost always get increased stamina or health for finishing side missions too, giving you more than ample reason to help your neighbors.\n\nThe style of Ashen is bleak, but charming. Like Mad Max with heart. There\u2019s something endearing about the faceless characters of Ashen\u2019s world, and it reminds me of Devolver\u2019s hit kung-fu RPG, Absolver. It\u2019s also worth noting that the NPCs of the village, unless you turn the option off in the settings, can and will be sometimes controlled by other players.\n\nThis is how the multiplayer of Ashen works. You might not often know who\u2019s with you, an NPC or a player, and the game does an excellent job of making it always feel like you\u2019re the leader, as it filters in people in the world who are in the same area, doing the same things as you. It\u2019s a technical marvel really, as without any means of communication, the NPCs wind up being more lifelike than people would be. You can\u2019t play co-op, the game just sort of filters in real people in and out of your game, and to them, YOU look like the NPC, not the player character. It\u2019s a crazy, genius way of doing things to make the in-game characters feel more alive.\n\nAll in all, though I\u2019m just a few hours into what promises to be a lengthy adventure, my early impression is that Ashen is worth the $40 pricetag, if you like third-person harrowing action RPGs in the vein of Dark Souls or the harder Zeldas out there. It\u2019s not heavy on stat sheets, character building, or idle chatter as much as it is on world exploration, dungeon diving, and secret finding. If that sounds like it\u2019s up your alley, give it a look on the Epic Games Store.", "keywords": ["weapons", "rpg", "npcs", "games", "ashen", "youll", "check", "world", "files", "dark", "characters", "game", "souls"], "summary": "Impulse game buyer that I am, I snapped up both Supergiant\u2019s Hades (because duh) and A44\u2019s stylish but mysterious RPG, Ashen.\nThe basics of Ashen will immediately make players think of Dark Souls - dodge-based combat, weapons and locked animations with stamina as a resource for everything.\nBut the more I play Ashen, the more I think of it as a Zelda-like, rather than \u201cyet another Souls game\u201d.\nIts massive open world, chatty NPCs, and evolving hometown of Vagrant\u2019s Rest gives Ashen a lot more heart than any Souls game or Bloodborne have ever had.\nThere\u2019s something endearing about the faceless characters of Ashen\u2019s world, and it reminds me of Devolver\u2019s hit kung-fu RPG, Absolver."}, {"link": "https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a25459434/1989-jeep-comanche-for-sale/", "published": "2018-12-10T20:00:00", "title": "Why Wait for the Gladiator When You Can Buy This Jeep Pickup Today?", "author": ["Travis Okulski"], "text": "The upcoming Jeep Gladiator pickup is, somehow, one of the most highly anticipated cars or trucks in recent memory. The mid-size truck market is experiencing a bit of a renaissance right now, so it makes sense that there'd be excitement over one that can drop its top and maintains all the ruggedness of a Wrangler. The problem? It's not for sale yet. The other problem? Mid-size trucks are getting pretty large. But there's a solution if you still want a Jeep pickup and don't want to wait.\n\nWelcome to You Must Buy, our daily look at the cars you really should be buying instead of that boring commuter sedan.\n\nBefore the Gladiator became even a glimmer in the back of your brain, Jeep was building a smaller pickup called the Comanche.

It's a driver with 157,000 miles on the odometer. If you think the paint looks weird, that's because it's not paint: the exterior is sprayed in bed liner. It has bigger tires and some bolt-on fenders that look very cool.\n\neBay\n\nThe description notes that it's not perfect, but that it can be a daily driver that is then taken off-road on weekends.

We saddled up and did the math. We saddled up and did the math.\n\nYesterday, Red Dead Online got its first major update after being in beta for more than a week. In a post on their newswire, Rockstar said the changes were \"specifically geared towards creating a more balanced, fun and rewarding overall experience, across all modes and missions,\" so of course, the big question is: does the update really do all that much to fix what so much of RDO's early user base was complaining about? The short answer is yes, it makes a huge difference - even if it doesn't fix all of the beta's problems.\n\nWhat's New\n\nThe first big change is that many items - especially weapons - are considerably more affordable. While prices for a few standard weapons like the Cattleman Revolver, Bow, and Carbine Repeater remain unchanged, all of the other firearms have been discounted by roughly 30-40%. The Mauser Pistol, for example, which once cost $1,000 now costs $600, while the powerful Semi-Auto Shotgun is down to $540 from its original $900 price tag. If, like me, you had already purchased a few weapons for their original prices - don't worry: Rockstar will be sending refunds out during the next week to reimburse you for whatever you overpaid. What's more is that other items are no longer locked behind Gold Bars, or what's sure to become Red Dead Online's premium currency. Most importantly for me was Horse Insurance, which now costs $125 as opposed to the previous cost of 5 gold bars, or almost a week's worth of grinding.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nAbove: Some things we think Red Dead Online could improve on - including the old economy.\n\nThankfully, that too is less of an issue after this first update. Whether you're grinding for cash or for gold, you'll find yourself having a decidedly easier time of it now. Both Story missions and Stranger jobs, as well as the Showdown and Race Series matches have all had their payouts increased, to the point where Rockstar's nerfing of the Sockeye Salmon price to $2.50 isn't as big a deal (though it wouldn't matter since you can no longer buy the Lake Lure for gold before reaching Rank 30). While Showdown matches previously rewarded $3-5 payouts per match, we're now able to earn that much even if we do absolutely terribly. Seriously, I spent an entire match just waving at people while being used for target practice and still came out of it with more than I did taking #1 and earning MVP before the update. Most of the matches I've played since Thursday's update have earned my between $10-$20, and while a few have netted me under $10, I've yet to earn less than $5 per match.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nSimilarly, the rewards for replaying Stranger and Story missions have been increased considerably - though the exact math eludes me, it seems like most missions have seen their rewards increase by $3-$4 each. The Gunslinger mission Highly Illegal and Highly Moral, for instance, initially doled out around $13 on a secondary run. Now, it rewards players with almost $18 for playing it again. Gold payouts seem to have increased to anywhere between 5 and 12 nuggets per Story mission, and Stranger tasks (the Free-Roam missions) are now worth roughly twice what they were previously.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nSo what does this ultimately mean for you, the intrepid explorers of this digital frontier? Well, mostly that while you may not be able to cheese fish for a quick buck anymore, you'll find it a lot more rewarding to simply play RDO instead of worrying about your earn rate. Yes, you'll still have to grind out a bunch of gold if you want to purchase more powerful horses like the Nokota or Andalusian, or even some of the cosmetics like gun metals or certain clothing items, but that seems to be something of the point. Without tanks or jetpacks to save up for, most of our Gold is going to be saved making our items and avatars more personal, towards our personal investment in what we choose to spend our earnings on, and really making your character yours.\n\nFor more Red Ded Online, you can find a bunch of helpful tips in our Red Dead 2 wiki, or see how we feel about our experience with the beta so far in our review-in-progress.\n\nJR is an editor at IGN, who is having a blast rootin' and tootin' around the old west.

He can\u2019t tell me where he\u2019s headed, but even if he could, he might not exactly know.\n\nLife for the world\u2019s most famous video gamer is at times too busy, too fantastical to completely take in.\n\nWhen Variety asks him how often he thinks about his year spent playing \u201cFortnite\u201d with the likes of Drake, appearing on Ellen and essentially becoming the modern face of gaming, there\u2019s a bit of a pause.\n\n\u201cNot very much,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really have time to think about things like that. It\u2019s insane with things all day: Interviews, shows, streaming as much as I do.\u201d\n\nWhile Blevins didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere, a video game streaming wunderkind manufactured by \u201cFortnite,\u201d Twitch, and YouTube, he wasn\u2019t exactly well known until 2018. He started streaming way back in 2010 or so, playing \u201cHalo Reach,\u201d the latest at the time in the Halo franchise that he adored. His following was essentially nonexistent until he started streaming the other battle royale game \u201cPUBG,\u201d where he averaged maybe 8,000 viewers. Then he moved over to \u201cH1Z1\u201d where a good day saw an audience of 15,000. But it wasn\u2019t until he started playing \u201cFortnite\u201d that he started to see the sort of massive success that began to catch the attention of media, the mainstream, and celebrities.\n\nBlevins believes that his \u201cFortnite\u201d success was driven by the \u201cpopularity of the game and the high demand of it being viewed on Twitch and YouTube.\u201d It also helped that Epic Games\u2019 battle royale title was available on every single platform. It wasn\u2019t long until \u201cFortnite\u201d toppled \u201cMinecraft\u201d \u2014 which had topped the YouTube charts for a decade or so.\n\nIn a year of memorable moments, Blevins says that his most treasured is when he hosted the first-ever \u201cFortnite\u201d tournament. The Vegas event broke his own viewer record.\n\n\u201cI\u201dve never hosted my own event ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve hosted LAN parties but that was about it. This was 300 to 400 people in the audience, broadcasting to 600,000 people. It was a huge accomplishment to me and my wife was there. It was amazing.\u201d\n\nAnother 2018 career highlight includes appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, something Blevins and his wife, streamer Jessica \u201cJGhosty\u201d Blevins helped arrange. Blevins said he and his wife are both huge fans of the show and he had always been interested in going on a talk show. In March, the two reached out to the show to see if they would be interested in having him on. But the show was on break and they didn\u2019t hear back. Then, months later, out of nowhere, the show contacted him to see if he would go on the show.\n\n\u201cI was very nervous because I don\u2019t do a lot of TV stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cEllen is a goddess. It was so much fun.\u201d\n\nWhile television is new to Blevins, his career was built on talking to a camera.

He said the appearance resulted in some \u201cmom tweets\u201d and an increase in parents watching his streams.\n\nPerhaps the most famous 2018 event for Blevins was his breakout appearance with Drake on a \u201cFortnite\u201d livestream. The March stream easily shattered the Twitch streaming record with about 600,000 viewers at its peak and soon included appearances by Travis Scott and the NFL\u2019s JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nBlevins says that stream had a massive impact not just on him and \u201cFortnite,\u201d but on gaming as a whole.\n\n\u201cDrake, that is what pushed gaming into the mainstream and made it cool,\u201d he said.\n\nSince then, Blevins has played host to a number of celebrity gamers on his stream but doesn\u2019t see Drake on \u201cFortnite\u201d as much recently.\n\nThe last two weeks, Blevins had a particularly busy time in L.A. He\u2019s prepping to launch an album of electronic dance music \u2014 something Capital Records approached him about, he taped something that he can\u2019t talk about until next week, and then taped an appearance on the Gamers\u2019 Choice Awards \u2014 which were televised on Sunday on CBS, and he both presented and won an award at the Game Awards last Wednesday.\n\nThe Game Awards moments gave him a chance to appear on screen with a Muppet, and to bask in the glow of an award for content creator of the year, an award designed to recognize a streamer, influencer or media member who has made an important and positive impact on the industry in 2018.\n\nAnd he\u2019s already on to what\u2019s next. He told Variety that he wants to work on a collaborative stream for Nintendo fighting game \u201cSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate,\u201d and that he\u2019s focusing now on his Times Square New Year\u2019s Eve party. The party is going to be live from the Paramount building in Times Square with Blevins streaming, along with special guests, from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. ET.\n\nAnd then after that, Blevins says, \u201cthree or four amazing things.\u201d", "keywords": ["gaming", "hes", "cool", "started", "appearance", "streaming", "ninja", "drake", "stream", "fortnite", "game", "ellen", "audience", "blevins"], "summary": "He started streaming way back in 2010 or so, playing \u201cHalo Reach,\u201d the latest at the time in the Halo franchise that he adored.\nHis following was essentially nonexistent until he started streaming the other battle royale game \u201cPUBG,\u201d where he averaged maybe 8,000 viewers.\nBlevins says that stream had a massive impact not just on him and \u201cFortnite,\u201d but on gaming as a whole.\n\u201cDrake, that is what pushed gaming into the mainstream and made it cool,\u201d he said.\nThe party is going to be live from the Paramount building in Times Square with Blevins streaming, along with special guests, from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m."}, {"link": "https://arstechnica.com/staff/2018/12/dealmaster-a-bunch-of-amazon-devices-are-back-on-sale-today/", "published": "2018-12-10T19:30:00", "title": "Dealmaster: A bunch of Amazon devices are back on sale today", "author": [], "text": "Greetings, Arsians!

Ruby Rose's iconic lesbian superhero officially made her debut during Monday's Arrow, part two of The CW's three-part superhero crossover \"Elseworlds.\"\n\nWith Earth-1 impacted by a magical book that altered reality, Monday's Arrow installment of The CW's big \"Elseworlds\" superhero crossover found The Flash\u2019s Barry (Grant Gustin), Arrow\u2019s Oliver (Stephen Amell) and Supergirl\u2019s Kara (Melissa Benoist) in Gotham to try and get to the bottom of things. Unfortunately for the heroes, a mugging (and their inability to stand down) landed the trio in jail, where they were bailed out by a mysterious figure \u2014 Kate Kane (Orange Is the New Black grad Rose), aka Batwoman.\n\n\"Our goal was trying to create a set-up, story-wise, where we could meet her, be intrigued by her, introduce Gotham a little bit ... and then have people wondering, 'What is this world she\u2019s part of?'\u201d Caroline Dries, who is developing The CW's Batwoman standalone series, told reporters. \"We just realized the best story for that would be if our guys went to Gotham and she helped out with their story and then shooed them away. So we knew who the character was going into it \u2026 the question for us was how to make her sort of mysterious.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the group didn\u2019t go away, and instead went to Arkham Asylum to try and track down Dr. John Deegan (Jeremy Davies), who started the reality-skewing mayhem. But Deegan wasn\u2019t willing to go down without a fight and released the criminally insane villains who were being housed at the infamous hospital.\n\n\n\nWith the heroes in trouble (again), Kane, as Batwoman, stepped in to save the day. It was a bit of a blow to Oliver, who spent much of the hour insisting that Gotham having its own hero was an urban legend. (Arrow had previously established Oliver\u2019s Green Arrow as the first vigilante; \"Elseworlds\" allowed that Batman existed in the same universe.)\n\n\n\nHowever, Bruce Wayne's current whereabouts remains a mystery, as he disappeared from Gotham three years earlier. In his absence, Kate \u2014 his cousin \u2014 has been picking up the pieces.\n\nThe familial connection gave Kate an extra tie to Kara, who has her own experience with a famous cousin who is prone to going MIA. And thanks to Kara\u2019s X-ray vision, she (privately) told Batwoman she knew she was really Kate. (Kate, similarly, knew Kara was Supergirl.)\n\n\n\n\"It was important for us to humanize Kate in a way that made her relatable to the other characters in the Arrow-verse, even though we were creating an enigmatic character,\u201d Dries said. \u201cWe wanted an in to her. In our minds, Kara obviously has a cousin [and she\u2019s] sort of in his [Superman's] shadow. Her story was getting out of his shadow, and that\u2019s exactly Kate\u2019s story. And so it was important for us to find a moment for them to bond \u2026 It felt like the right moment, the right move.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Gotham\u2019s inhabitants are some of the best-known comic-based characters, it was important to find the right woman to step into Kate\u2019s shoes. \"Ruby has a really strong, silent presence,\u201d Dries said. \u201cHer look is so powerful that you don\u2019t want to take her eyes off of her. She brings so much to the plate, we realized, with just standing there and absorbing what the other guys are talking about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite moments was when they show up at Wayne Enterprises and they\u2019re all kind of bickering about Batman and she\u2019s just standing there waiting for them to figure out this stuff,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo that\u2026was a fun surprise.\u201c\n\nIf Batwoman goes to series, it will also mark an important milestone: Rose will be the first LGBTQ lead in a live-action superhero series. (The character description for Kate also notes she\u2019s an \u201cout lesbian,\u201d though the Arrow hour of the crossover didn't dive into her romantic life.) \u201dIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Dries said. \u201cIt seems like it should have happened already, but here we are. We\u2019re pumped [and] very blessed.\u201d\n\nThe Elseworlds crossover concludes Tuesday on The CW.", "keywords": ["elseworlds", "dc", "comics", "shes", "important", "world", "batwoman", "superhero", "kara", "fit", "arrow", "dries", "kate", "gotham", "cws"], "summary": "[This story contains spoilers from part two of The CW's \"Elseworlds\" crossover.]\nRuby Rose's iconic lesbian superhero officially made her debut during Monday's Arrow, part two of The CW's three-part superhero crossover \"Elseworlds.\"\n'\u201d Caroline Dries, who is developing The CW's Batwoman standalone series, told reporters.\n(Arrow had previously established Oliver\u2019s Green Arrow as the first vigilante; \"Elseworlds\" allowed that Batman existed in the same universe.)\n(The character description for Kate also notes she\u2019s an \u201cout lesbian,\u201d though the Arrow hour of the crossover didn't dive into her romantic life.)"}, {"link": "https://www.wired.com/story/new-godzilla-trailer", "published": "2018-12-10T19:18:00", "title": "Watch This New Monster-Filled Godzilla Trailer Right Now", "author": ["Brian Raftery", "Graeme Mcmillan", "Geek'S Guide To The Galaxy", "Stephen Mcarthur", "Angela Watercutter", "Jon Gertner", "Garrett M.

It looks like the trailer was able to live up to the hype, scoring a record-breaking amount of views in just 24 hours. The new footage teased a bleak outlook for the Avengers, who have one last plan to reverse the damage done by Thanos (Josh Brolin). What is that plan? Beats me, because this trailer sure didn't share it. There have been no shortage of rumors and theories about Avengers: Endgame, but the trailer leaves most of those unaddressed. It instead sets the mood for the movie, and while it's great that Marvel is keeping things close to the vest, there's still an incredible amount of things we don't know about this film. Maybe these answers will surface the closer we get to April, but these are some of the big things that the trailer didn't reveal. What Is Cap's Plan? Let's start with the biggest thing that the trailer teased. It looks like Captain America and Black Widow have a plan to bring back everyone that Thanos killed in Avengers: Infinity War. However, we are left to wonder what that actual plan entails. It's clearly a last-ditch effort, but what can the Avengers possibly do to reverse the damage caused by the Infinity Gauntlet? There are a few theories about this online, but the trailer offers no clues to make any one theory stand above the rest. It's likely to be a key driver of the plot, so it makes sense that the secret wouldn't be dropped so easily. Is There Going To Be Time Travel? Keeping with Cap's plan, one of the most popular theories is that it will involve time travel. It's long been rumored that time travel will be a factor in Endgame, with set photos revealing scenes that appear to take place during the Battle of New York in The Avengers. We don't see any obvious hint at time travel in Endgame, though, some eagle-eyed secret hunters have found what they believe to be evidence. The video footage of Scott Lang at the Avengers facility is supposedly from the archives, meaning that it's an old recording. If anything, it shows the lengths that some people had to go to get information from this trailer. Does Pepper Potts Suit Up? Thanks to a set photo of Gwyneth Paltrow in what looks like her own suit of Iron Man armor, rumors have been flying that Pepper Potts will finally suit up as her comic book alter ego, Rescue. Pepper never physically makes an appearance in the trailer but her presence is felt. Tony Stark opens the trailer by leaving her what he thinks will be his final message. Does this recording somehow get to Pepper, and she sets off to rescue him? The set photo is a strong case that Pepper will get her own suit, but we are left guessing as to how and why that will happen. Is Everyone Snapped Still Alive? Infinity War had one of the most shocking endings for a blockbuster, wiping out several fan-favorite characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man. Not many fans believed this to be a permanent death, and people have been theorizing how these characters could be brought back to life. A popular one is that every victim of The Decimation is actually inside of the Soul Stone. We saw that orange-tinged world at the end of Infinity War, so everyone's souls could still exist. However, as far as the Endgame trailer is concerned, everyone is good and dead. Who Is A Greater Threat Than Thanos? Thanos may have been the man who defeated the Avengers and wiped out half of all life in the cosmos, but there's a rumor that he's not the only bad guy in town. According to leaked promotional material, there is an even greater threat in Endgame that the Avengers need to defeat. The trailer keeps the focus on Thanos, and even then it doesn't ever show his face. If there is something worse out there in the universe, that has some big implications, it's sure to be a hot topic of debate among fans until more concrete information is made available. How Did Ant-Man Escape The Quantum Realm? Though he had to sit out Infinity War, Ant-Man is back in the Avengers' inner-circle for Endgame. When we last saw the character in Ant-Man and the Wasp, he was trapped in the Quantum Realm with seemingly no one alive who knows that he survived The Decimation. However, we see that he did manage to escape and find his way to the Avengers compound in the trailer with no explanation as to how. Given Cap and Black Widow's reaction, Scott's arrival is a big deal. The Quantum Realm is involved in a lot of theories, mostly that it is the key to time travel. Some people think that Scott escaped through time travel, so he could end up becoming a pivotal character in the film. Who Are The Other Missing Characters? We saw a lot of major characters dissolve into dust in Infinity War, but there are still a lot of characters who we don't know what happened to, like Valkyrie. In the trailer, we see Bruce Banner looking at a list of characters that are likely to have been victims of The Decimation. This includes one character we already knew (Spider-Man), one we didn't (Shuri), and one the Avengers think is missing (Ant-Man). However, I would like to say that I don't trust anything in Marvel trailers anymore. They are known to hide or change details in trailers through CGI, like Thor's eye patch. They also film entire scenes just for the trailer, so who's to say that Shuri is actually missing? Where Is Captain Marvel? The Avengers will get a major helping hand in the form of Captain Marvel. The character, who was teased during a post-credits scene in Infinity War, will be making her debut in Captain Marvel before getting to meet the Avengers in Endgame. Captain Marvel will be a big player in this movie, but we're not totally sure how she will make her entrance. Much of that depends on the ending of her solo film. Some are theorizing that she will be the one to save Tony in outer space. Though she doesn't show up in this trailer, I wouldn't be surprised if she made an appearance in the second trailer, much like what Captain America: Civil War did with Spider-Man. 7 Major Things The 'Avengers: Endgame' Trailer Taught Us Blended From Around The Web Facebook\n\nBack to top", "keywords": ["war", "chose", "infinity", "travel", "marvel", "trailer", "avengers", "plan", "characters", "endgame", "hidden", "secrets", "captain"], "summary": "8 Marvel Secrets The Avengers: Endgame Trailer Chose To Keep Hidden By Matt Wood Random Article Blend At long last, the trailer for Avengers: Endgame was finally released!\nThere have been no shortage of rumors and theories about Avengers: Endgame, but the trailer leaves most of those unaddressed.\nHowever, as far as the Endgame trailer is concerned, everyone is good and dead.\nCaptain Marvel will be a big player in this movie, but we're not totally sure how she will make her entrance.\n7 Major Things The 'Avengers: Endgame' Trailer Taught Us Blended From Around The Web FacebookBack to top"}, {"link": "https://komonews.com/news/entertainment/netflix-releases-new-stranger-things-trailer", "published": "2018-12-10T17:45:51", "title": "Starcourt Mall, Suzie teased in new Stranger Things teaser trailer", "author": ["Kyle Proctor"], "text": "Netflix has released a new teaser for the upcoming third season of Stranger Things.\n\nWhile no new footage was released, the episode titles were all dropped inside the trailer:\n\nSuzie, Do You Copy?\n\nThe Mall Rats\n\nThe Case of the Missing Life Guard\n\nThe Sauna Test\n\nThe Source\n\nThe Birthday\n\nThe Bite\n\nThe Battle of Starcourt\n\nPerhaps the most interesting title of all is the finale episode \"The Battle at Starcourt.\" Netflix teased in July that the Starcourt Mall would be a part of the show with a special teaser released back in July and referenced the location in two episode titles.\n\nOne final mystery from the titles that not much has been released is who exactly Suzie is.

While a spin-off like this month\u2019s Bumblebee makes sense within the world of the five live-action films, a total reboot would leave a lot of threads hanging. Transformers: The Last Knight was originally planned to launch an extended Transformers universe. Even if that scaled back, it suggested that the villainous Unicron is still looming, and a post-credits scene even suggested that Quintessa was still alive, in human form.\n\nSpeaking with /Film about Bumblebee, producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura gave us the lowdown on the future of the Transformers franchise.\n\nRumors of a Reboot Have Been Grossly Exaggerated\n\n\u201cReboot\u201d is one of those words the media likes to throw around. It applied to Casino Royale and Batman Begins because they completely started those franchises over from scratch. But just because a franchise is changing course doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a reboot. X-Men: First Class was called a reboot, but the original X-Men cast returned for the next one.\n\n\u201cReboot, I always hate that word because for one, I\u2019m not sure I really understand what it means,\u201d Di Bonaventura said. \u201cWe are going to do another big Transformers movie. It is going to be different than the ones that we\u2019ve done before.\u201d\n\nCourse Correction\n\nThe Last Knight was a franchise low at the box office, so it\u2019s no surprise the producers have paid attention. Just by virtue of hiring a director who isn\u2019t Michael Bay, the next Transformers is going to be different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we look at the elements of what we did before and go, \u2018Well, let\u2019s not do this\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s not do that,\u2019\u201d Di Bonaventura said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about how do you evolve the experience for the fans. Let the fan have a new experience.\u201d\n\nSomething new from the previous five Michael Bay movies in a row won\u2019t necessarily be a reboot, but it will be an evolution. In a way, just doing a live-action Transformers was an evolution in 2007.\n\n\u201cWhen we did the first movie, at first there was a lot of pushback that we weren\u2019t doing it the way it was done before, \u201cDi Bonaventura said. \u201cMy feeling was always that if we\u2019d done it, you would\u2019ve gone, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve already seen it.\u2019 So how do you evolve things forward is I think the hardest thing because you\u2019ve got to retain why people love it, but at the same time if you give them the same experience, they\u2019re going to be bored with it.\u201d\n\nWhere in the Universe is Unicron?\n\nEven if fans demand change, a total reboot would probably leave just as many unsatisfied. Having set up elements like Unicron, to just ignore them would also be a different sort of cheat. Di Bonaventura is less concerned about the loose threads than he is making sure the next movie is good.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to be controversial,\u201d Di Bonaventura said. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Unicron. It\u2019s too big. It\u2019s so big it\u2019s beyond any sort of relatable thing I think, for me personally. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to be in the series someday. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve thought much about it honestly because we\u2019ve been focused on this movie.\u201d\n\nBumblebee is the Key\n\nBumblebee does a lot for the Transformers franchise.

There's also a lot to learn from the voices who still feel uninvited to speak or unheard when they do.\n\nIn a new interview with the New York Times, former Transformers star Megan Fox addressed why she hasn't joined the numerous other women coming forward about their experiences of sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood. And her answer is a wake up call to anyone who thinks we've progressed beyond victim-blaming after #MeToo.\n\nBecause despite having, \"quite a few stories\" of her own, Fox said:\n\n\"Even with the #MeToo movement, and everyone coming out with stories \u2014 and one could assume that I probably have quite a few stories, and I do \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak out for many reasons. I just didn\u2019t think based on how I\u2019d been received by people, and by feminists, that I would be a sympathetic victim. And I thought if ever there were a time where the world would agree that it\u2019s appropriate to victim-shame someone, it would be when I come forward with my story.\"\n\nThat's a gut-punch assessment for two reasons.\n\nFor one, Fox is right: Only the \"right\" kind of victims tend to be heard, even in these unprecedented times. Anyone society has dehumanized into a sex object just doesn't fit the bill. While obviously dealing with other more severe disenfranchisement issues, it's one of the reasons why sex workers have been disregarded when they've tried to participate.\n\nMegan Fox's role in the 'Transformers' films doomed her to a life of ridicule. Image: paramount\n\nBecause despite a conscious understanding of why victim blaming and slut shaming is wrong, those biases still rear their heads when it comes to seeing women with marketed sexuality as potential victims of sexual assault.\n\nFor another, Fox was actually telling the world what we'd probably now consider #MeToo stories long before there was a hashtag.\n\nIn a November 2017 Mary Sue article, writer Princess Weekes outlined the long list of ways Fox was mistreated by the press, public, and industry who needed to see her as nothing more than a bimbo sex symbol. Sure, Fox wasn't a saint, saying plenty of things about her bisexuality and using ableist language that isn't acceptable today. But she was an outspoken woman trying to own her sexuality.\n\nWe never applauded her for being brave enough to speak out against the sexist behavior she endured in the industry\n\nYet the world refused to see her as a multi-dimensional human being. And we never applauded her for being brave enough to call out the sexist behavior she endured in the industry.\n\nAmong the litany of things Fox has described in the past, her first introduction to Transformers director Michael Bay sticks out.\n\nShe was a 15-year-old extra for a club scene in Bad Boys II clad in nothing but a bikini and six-inch heels, according to a 2009 Jimmy Kimmel interview. Bay approved of including her in the scene, but when told that her age would not allow them to show her drinking, his solution was, \"to then have me dancing underneath a waterfall getting soaking wet. And that\u2019s \u2026 at 15. I was in tenth grade. So that\u2019s sort of a microcosm of how Bay\u2019s mind works.\"\n\nIn a 2009 Observer interview, Fox told the author how she got the gig as the hyper-sexualized Mikaela in Transformers:\n\n\"She told me she went to director Michael Bay\u2019s house to audition and he made her wash his Ferrari while he filmed her. She said she didn\u2019t know what had happened to the footage. When I put it to Bay himself, he looked suitably abashed. \u2018Er, I don\u2019t know where it is either.\u2019\"\n\nNo red flags there!\n\nNewsflash: Megan Fox can be sexy *and* treated like a human being at the same time. Image: GAMMA/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nTo be clear, Fox has not made any specific accusations, and we can't assume whether or not she considers any of the above in the mold of other behavior brought to light by #MeToo. She may very well feel as though she was not a victim in any of these situations \u2014 but she did tell the Times she had \"quite a few\" stories she felt would have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWe failed to listen or even show we cared to.\n\nBack in 2009, she became the stereotype of an idiotic sex object who, by extension, did not deserve our sympathies or questions about whether the treatment she received was OK.\n\nToday, the public knows more about the complicated, often dangerous nexus of misogyny that young women and men looking to make it in Hollywood face. And maybe now we can take responsibility for unwittingly participating in some of the sexism directed at Fox back then.\n\nThe idea is to continue to look back and shine a light on the blindspots to abuse. And to fight to ensure that everyone feels safe enough to come forward.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to say this about myself, but let\u2019s say that I was ahead of my time and so people weren\u2019t able to understand,\" Fox said in the Times interview. \"Instead, I was rejected because of qualities that are now being praised in other women coming forward.\"", "keywords": ["times", "victim", "transformers", "world", "foxs", "interview", "metoo", "told", "women", "comments", "learn", "lot", "sex", "megan", "fox"], "summary": "There's a lot to celebrate about the voices amplified by #MeToo.\nThere's also a lot to learn from the voices who still feel uninvited to speak or unheard when they do.\nAnd her answer is a wake up call to anyone who thinks we've progressed beyond victim-blaming after #MeToo.\nMegan Fox's role in the 'Transformers' films doomed her to a life of ridicule.\nFor another, Fox was actually telling the world what we'd probably now consider #MeToo stories long before there was a hashtag."}, {"link": "https://www.apnews.com/b8213f4add8a4faab08daf48ffe12fc9", "published": "2018-12-11T01:41:15", "title": "Man who claimed Howard Hughes inheritance dies in Nevada", "author": ["Ken Ritter"], "text": "FILE - In this Nov. 10, 2005 file photo, Melvin Dummar smiles after signing copies of a book that Gary Magnesen had written about Dummar's claims that Howard Hughes left him a portion of the Hughes estate.

Photo: Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nCardi B and Offset have been thrilling us with their romance for nearly two years now, a lifetime in celebrity dating. It seemed like every day, black Twitter had something new to go in on, from cheating rumors to secret babies to a real baby. Through it all, there was always something about the way Cardi would tweet about \u201cSet,\u201d about the graphic references to him in her songs, and about Offset\u2019s telling the New York Times \u201cShe\u2019s No. 1, so every time I\u2019m hitting the charts, I\u2019ve got to be Top 10.\u201d Their hood love story may be coming to an end, but it warrants a reread.\n\nJanuary 20, 2017 Almost two years ago, Cardi B and Offset first collaborated on her song \u201cLick,\u201d a single off of Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 2. At that point, Cardi B was still more well-known as a reality TV star, and Migos\u2019 second album, Culture (which featured the instantly iconic \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d), was just about to drop.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017 All the dating rumors that had been swirling around were finally vindicated when Cardi and Offset went to the Super Bowl together. Cardi B posted a fun string of Instagram Stories and, at one point, Offset went live. Of course, they rooted for the Atlanta Falcons (insert Offset\u2019s bird noise). Cardi B admits that she\u2019s \u201conly going for the Atlanta Falcon niggas because them motherfucking Patriot niggas, they support Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFebruary 14, 2017 In a since-deleted post, Cardi shared her Valentine\u2019s Day date with Offset.\n\nMarch 17, 2017 But before things get too serious, Cardi B denies dating \u201can Atlanta guy.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even call him by his name.\n\nApril 16, 2017 Cardi continues this trend throughout this \u201cWill they/Won\u2019t they?\u201d phase of their relationship. In an incredible and odd interview with Tim Westwood, she calls Offset \u201cthe boy\u201d multiple times, refusing to say the man\u2019s name. Power moves only.\n\nMay 1, 2017 Cardi and Offset show off the drip at a Met Gala afterparty, all but confirming that Cardi puts the pussy on Offset.\n\nJuly 25, 2017 Offset\u2019s jeweler posts this incredible piece for Cardi B, just a casual little late summer gift to his girl.\n\nSeptember 20, 2017 Cardi B and Offset get married. But we don\u2019t know that yet.\n\nOctober 11, 2017 Happy Birthday, Bardi! Offset shares a sweet post on Instagram, with an all-caps caption.\n\nReasons why me and Offset got into it ...I think he stoled my purple blanket \ud83d\ude12but it wasn\u2019t him so I\u2019m still looking for the suspect \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) October 22, 2017\n\nOctober 22, 2017 It isn\u2019t long before there\u2019s trouble in paradise. Cardi writes \u201cSingle\u201d on an Instagram story, as if to tell the world she and Offset are done. But almost as quickly as they were broken up, she tweets that they were never not together. She was just being petty about a blanket.\n\nOctober 27, 2017 In front of thousands of people, Offset got down on one knee to propose to Cardi B at Powerhouse 2017. She\u2019s genuinely surprised, probably because they were already married. Later, she tells Jimmy Fallon that she thought Offset was gonna surprise her with something, since he missed her birthday.\n\nNovember 18, 2017 After a complicated court case, Offset reveals he has three kids with three other women, one of whom is taking him to court for unpaid child support. Really puts the 8-karat ring into perspective.\n\nDecember 8, 2017 The music video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d by Migos, featuring Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, drops. In case you weren\u2019t yet aware, Cardi gets \u201cOffset off.\u201d She turns \u201cOffset on.\u201d\n\nDecember 14, 2017 Not to be outdone, when Offset\u2019s 26th birthday rolled around (who here is surprised that the rapper is a Sagittarius?), Cardi B got him a Rolls-Royce. A $400,000 Rolls-Royce Wraith. Given to him at his Met Gala-themed birthday party, \u201cThe Set Gala,\u201d which featured a massive Bentley ice sculpture. There\u2019s nothing left to say.\n\nATTENTION PLEASE READ !It might answer your question ....... BARTIER CARDI !!! pic.twitter.com/YOTrQPDkdB \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 23, 2017\n\nDecember 22, 2017 Cardi B\u2019s next single off of Invasion of Privacy is released. Just like in \u201cMotorsport,\u201d she delivers a line about her sex life: \u201cCardi put the pussy on Offset (Say what?) / Cartier, Cardi B brain on Offset.\u201d The instant hit made it to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, but fans were a little annoyed that Cardi kept referencing her man in songs. She did not care.\n\nDecember 25, 2017 Over the holiday weekend, Offset\u2019s iCloud was hacked, releasing photos and videos of a naked Cardi onto the internet. The hacker also shared a photo of another woman, allegedly taken by Offset. Cardi didn\u2019t immediately respond to the cheating allegations, but she did make it clear she\u2019s fine with people seeing her naked.\n\nPeople keep posting the nude videos of me like if i wasn\u2019t a stripper before \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fYou know there\u2019s videos of me stripping with my titties & ass out on YouTube already right \ud83d\ude02?anyways i know i know i got a nice body right \ud83d\ude0e \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 25, 2017\n\nDecember 28, 2017 An Instagram model named Celina Powell claims she\u2019s pregnant with Offset\u2019s child. Pretty much everyone shrugs, because at this point, anything is possible. But Cardi and Offset flat-out deny it. Celina later comes out with the truth (after a friend exposes her) and Cardi B just laughs.\n\nDecember 30, 2017 At Holiday Hip-Hop Festival, Cardi B delivered Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s ominous \u201cYou [do] that shit again, you gon\u2019 lose your wife\u201d line onstage. Was it a reference to the cheating rumors? A warning to Offset to get it together? Or a necessary tribute to Beyonc\u00e9, whom we should all invoke at least once a day?\n\nJanuary 20, 2018 Needless to say, CardiSet does not enter 2018 on a good note. Fans and critics call out Migos for their homophobic lyrics and Cardi defends him. The internet considers canceling Cardi.\n\nApril 5, 2018 Cardi B\u2019s much-anticipated debut album drops. Invasion of Privacy features Migos on the song \u201cDrip,\u201d but the more important Offset reference happens in \u201cBe Careful.\u201d In the slow, intimidating rap, Cardi goes off on her cheating boo, even thinking (out loud) of ways to murder him. She may reference Lemonade, but it\u2019s clear that Cardi\u2019s version of that story ends at \u201cDon\u2019t Hurt Yourself.\u201d\n\nApril 7, 2018 Pregnancy rumors are a constant possibility with female celebrities. After vehemently denying them (\u201cNo, bitch, I\u2019m just getting fat\u201d), the Saturday Night Live camera pulls back on a glowing Cardi B during her guest performance to reveal her baby bump as she raps \u201cBe Careful.\u201d\n\nThis why i name my album \u201cInvasion of privacy\u201d cause people will do the most to be nosey about your life .Welp fuck it . pic.twitter.com/U3uHFOT3qK \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) June 25, 2018\n\nJune 25, 2018 Surprise! Belcalis Almanzar and Kiari Kendrell Cephus have been married for months! Cardi B shared a photo of the nuptials, which took place on the same day as the proposal, in Georgia, with Cardi\u2019s cousin as a witness. Later, Cardi posted a Notes app explanation, adding, \u201cThis is why I name my album Invasion of Privacy.\u201d\n\nJuly 10, 2018 Welcome to the world, Kulture! Cardi B and Offset welcomed their first child in July, a baby girl named Kulture.\n\nAugust 29, 2018 Fans freak out over Cardi B\u2019s allegedly fighting a woman whom she thought Offset was cheating with. Neither Cardi nor Offset address this rumor, but the other women involved deny having slept with Offset.\n\nSeptember 10, 2018 Nicki Minaj taunts Cardi B on her radio show following their altercation at NYFW, claiming to have knowledge that Cardi ordered an attack on women she believed had slept with Offset during their relationship. \u201cYou getting girls beat up because of what your man\u2019s doing? Who are you angry at, sweetheart? You got these women crying and scared to leave their house,\u201d Nicki says. \u201cThis is not about Offset. There are women out here running hurt, running wild. There\u2019s a reason why she\u2019s doing these things.\u201d\n\nOctober 1, 2018 Cardi B is charged with assault and reckless endangerment in connection with an altercation at a New York strip club in August. She\u2019s accused of attacking two female bartenders, who go by Jade and Baddie G, at the Angels Strip Club in Queens, having believed that Jade had slept with Offset, which Jade denied. Jade claims that Cardi had ordered a separate attack on her on another date in August and \u201cthreatened\u201d her for months, including in person and on Instagram.\n\nOctober 9, 2018 In her W magazine profile, Cardi B addresses the cheating scandal. \u201cEvery single day there\u2019s rumors about me and my dude,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd it almost drives me crazy, because I start to believe them.\u201d\n\nNovember 29, 2018 Offset tells the New York Times that he and Cardi B plan to do a joint album. \u201cThe difference that I\u2019ve seen in him lately is that he\u2019s in an adoring, loving relationship,\u201d Offset\u2019s lawyer, Drew Findling, tells the Times. \u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous Cardi fan and in like fashion, she\u2019s a tremendous Kiari Cephus fan.\u201d\n\nDeember 4, 2018 A woman claiming to be a friend of rapper Cuban Doll\u2019s accuses Offset of attempting to cheat on Cardi with Cuban Doll and another woman. She shares screenshots of his alleged texts dated June 28 (shortly before Kulture was born) with Cuban Doll suggesting a threesome with her and another woman, as well as photos of them on FaceTime together. Offset denies any inappropriate behavior in a since-deleted message.\n\nDecember 5, 2018 In a classic Cardi B Instagram video, recalling the days of \u201ca hoe never gets cold,\u201d before the international stardom, the marriage, and the baby, Cardi B tells the world that she and Offset are no longer together. \u201cWe got a lot of love for each other but things just haven\u2019t been working out between us for a long time,\u201d she tells the camera. Despite Offset\u2019s defeated comment, \u201cY\u2019all won,\u201d this is one couple that might be able to maintain the friendship, not to mention the business partnership.\n\nAwkward timing be damned, Cardi later shares the precious first full-face photo of their daughter, Kulture, who\u2019s at the center of this whole mess.\n\nDecember 6, 2018 Summer Bunni, one of the women Offset allegedly cheated on Cardi B with, issues quite the tearful statement and apology to Cardi for sleeping with her man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how serious this marriage was\u201d she told TMZ, claiming that she hasn\u2019t \u201cmessed\u201d with Offset since Kulture was born. \u201cI feel ashamed \u2026 I never wanted to break up a happy home.\u201d She added on Instagram, \u201cI will always be woman enough to admit when I was wrong, and in this situation I was. Seeing another woman\u2019s pain does not bring me any joy, nor do I thing [sic] it\u2019s funny.\u201d Meanwhile, Cuban Doll throws in her two cents, tweeting she \u201cnever went to new or lean,\u201d a reference to Offset\u2019s alleged texts arranging their tryst, presumably meaning New Orleans. In another plot twist, TMZ also reports that Summer previously co-starred in Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cFefe\u201d video over the summer. Stir! That! Pot!\n\nDecember 8, 2018 Since she can\u2019t do a mass-delete of all the times she mentions Offset in her songs, Cardi got creative at Chicago\u2019s B96 Jingle Bash. She rapped, \u201cI get up set off / I turn Offset on / I told him the other day / Yeah, we gon\u2019 get a divorce\u201d in the Migos song \u201cMotorsport.\u201d The original lyric is \u201cMan, we should sell that porn.\u201d Cardi really said \u201cthank u, next.\u201d\n\nDecember 9, 2018 The feeling is not mutual. Offset tweeted early Sunday morning, presumably after being tagged in that video of Cardi rapping a thousand times, \u201cFUCK YALL I MISS CARDI.\u201d Somewhere, Cardi B is twerking to her own lyric from \u201cI Like It\u201d: \u201cI like texts from my exes when they want a second chance.\u201d\n\nFUCK YALL I MISS CARDI \u2014 OFFSET (@OffsetYRN) December 9, 2018\n\nLater that day, Cardi went live on Instagram and addressed rumors that her relationship was fake. \u201cAin\u2019t no type of publicity that I would ever want that would have my daughter looking at me crazy when she gets older,\u201d she said, as fans sent heart emojis and congratulated her on her Grammy nominations.", "keywords": ["shes", "2017", "cardi", "iamcardib", "women", "relationship", "instagram", "complete", "timeline", "offsets", "offset", "2018", "b", "complicated"], "summary": "April 16, 2017 Cardi continues this trend throughout this \u201cWill they/Won\u2019t they?\u201d phase of their relationship.\nJuly 25, 2017 Offset\u2019s jeweler posts this incredible piece for Cardi B, just a casual little late summer gift to his girl.\nSeptember 20, 2017 Cardi B and Offset get married.\npic.twitter.com/YOTrQPDkdB \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 23, 2017December 22, 2017 Cardi B\u2019s next single off of Invasion of Privacy is released.\nCelina later comes out with the truth (after a friend exposes her) and Cardi B just laughs."}, {"link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/995079/nikki-bella-reveals-the-status-of-her-relationship-with-peter-kraus", "published": "2018-12-10T23:07:00", "title": "Nikki Bella Reveals the Status of Her Relationship With Peter Kraus", "author": [], "text": "Nikki Bella is \"enjoying being single\" following her split from John Cena.\n\nThe WWE couple split in April after six years together, announcing their breakup in a joint statement.

While Jamie takes young William on a tour of the land, Claire nurses John back to health and the two confess their jealousies: She\u2019s envious of the time he spent with Jamie after she\u2019d gone back through the stones; he wishes he could have the look of satisfaction she wears being with a man she loves.\n\nAfter John and William leave, Claire relaxes in a bath as Jamie pours warm water over her back (\u201cSo often I\u2019ve burned for you. This water on your skin, caressing you. It makes me jealous of the rain itself,\u201d he says). Eventually, Jamie reveals why he\u2019d given Murtagh one of his mother\u2019s candlesticks last episode: He\u2019d asked him to fashion a new wedding ring for Claire, with an inscription that translates to \u201cGive me a thousand kisses,\u201d a reference to their special poem.\n\nFor Balfe, that scene was especially poignant because it came after those intense yet ultimately uplifting conversations with Lord John. \u201cWhat I love is that Claire\u2019s not insecure about her love for Jamie or Jamie\u2019s love for her. These other people may come in, and they may, in some way, claim ownership or whatever that might be, but it doesn\u2019t make Claire insecure,\u201d Balfe told Vulture. \u201cShe may feel pain, or it may not be easy to hear, but it never undermines her belief that they\u2019re soulmates to each other.

Here is everything to know about why Sophia Bush left the show before her contract was up.\n\nSophia Bush quit Chicago P.D. because filming was bad for her health\n\nThe actress revealed that filming the cop show wasn\u2019t easy and bad for her health. She revealed on Dax Shepherd\u2019s podcast, Armchair Expert, \u201cI quit because, what I\u2019ve learned is I\u2019ve been so programmed to be a good girl and to be a work horse and be a tug boat that I have always prioritized tugging the ship for the crew, for the show, for the group, ahead of my own health \u2026 My body was, like, falling apart, because I was really, really unhappy.\u201d\n\nShe specifically pointed out that filming in cold weather was a struggle for her but the writers thought \u201csnow looks so cool on camera.\u201d Bush added that eventually, this led to a change in how she was on set.\n\n\u201cNearing my tenure there, I was probably difficult to be around because I was in so much pain and I felt so ignored,\u201d admitted Bush. \u201cI feel like I was standing butt naked, bruised and bleeding in the middle of Times Square, screaming at the top of my lungs and not a single person stopped to ask if they could help me.\u201d\n\nShe said met with bosses multiple times and brought up the possibility of suing to leave\n\nSophia Bush in Chicago P.D. | NBC Sophia Bush in Chicago P.D. | NBC\n\nActors tend to be contracted for multiple seasons so television shows won\u2019t lose their cast members. So it wasn\u2019t easy for Sophia Bush to leave Chicago P.D. She was contracted for seven seasons.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018OK, you can put me in the position of going quietly of my own accord or you can put me in the position of suing the network to get me out of my deal and I\u2019ll write an op-ed for The New York Times and tell them why,'\u201d explained Bush.\n\nBush previously claimed she also gave them a chance to change things before she left\n\nIt seems like there were several ultimatums that led to Bush\u2019s eventual departure from Chicago P.D. She previously said on the podcast UnStyled, that she talked with her bosses between Season 3 and 4 saying \u201cIf something really drastic doesn\u2019t change, I\u2019m leaving at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBecause I understand how the business works and how women are treated \u2014 I said, \u2018I\u2019m giving you not two weeks notice and I\u2019m not coming in here throwing sh*t and breaking lamps and saying I\u2019m never coming back.

Miami Art Week has come and gone. And whether you were a 24-hour party person all week or stayed home to avoid the crowds and traffic, you're probably relieved there'll be no more fairs, fests, or flaky tourists clogging the city.\n\nSo who came out on top last week? And who got trampled beneath the hordes of arty onlookers?\n\nInstitute of Contemporary Art Miami is among the recipients of Knight Foundation's $37 million in grants. Iwan Baan\n\nWinners:\n\nYear-round culture. Art Week had only just begun when the Knight Foundation dropped some major news: The organization pumped $37 million into Miami's arts community. The funds will buoy big names such as New World Symphony and the Institute of Contemporary Art, as well as individual artists such as Octavia Yearwood and the band Afrobeta. Art Basel mayhem lasts only one week, but investments like this allow Miamians to enjoy the arts year-round.\n\nButterflies at Free! Art Fair. Carl Timpone/BFA.com\n\nFree! After the success of last year's all-women art fair, titled Fair, Anthony Spinello and his team returned to Brickell City Centre last week with Free!, a collection of works exploring what it means to be free. If a feminist art exhibit in an upscale retail mall seemed edgy last year, Free! upped the ante, exposing shoppers to critiques of consumerism, including one work that earned headlines early: Genevieve Gaignard\u2019s Counter Fit, which hung over a Victoria's Secret shop, the juxtaposition seeming to push back against fat-shaming and anti-trans statements made by the company's CMO last month. But there was far more to the show, including artist Emilio Rojas' captivating, heart-wrenching performance, which included tattooing the shape of the U.S.-Mexico border along his spine and bringing several onlookers to tears; and Franky Cruz's canvases created by butterflies emerging from their chrysalises.\n\nMarginalized groups. To be clear, the art world has a long, long way to go before women and people of color are fairly represented. But that doesn't mean we can't celebrate the justly popular works created by them at Miami Art Week this year. Derrick Adams' playground at Faena, inspired by Overtown's history, was a fixture on social media feeds. Judy Chicago's exhibits at the ICA and the gallery Nina Johnson made headlines. The Miami Girls' Foundation staged a public performance at Untitled. And events focusing on artists of color seemed to have multiplied, with the Museum of Contemporary Art's \"AfriCobra,\" \"Darker Gods,\" and others joining long-running fairs such as Art Africa and Prizm.\n\nLosers:\n\nLive music. As New Times pointed out last week, Miami Art Week has transformed into a mini Miami Music Week, with all the DJ-heavy parties that implies. With several notable exceptions, live music was nearly absent in comparison with previous years. And maybe that's because audiences are no longer hungry for it. A Women/N/Sound showcase featuring Leikeli47 at Yo Space had onlookers fired up \u2014 but the crowd was sparse. And audiences at Saturday night's Pharrell performance, part of American Express's Platinum House at 1 Hotel South Beach, barely moved as the artist brought out N.E.R.D. collaborator Shay Haley for several throwback hits. The lack of enthusiasm was so apparent that Pharrell called it out, at one point shrugging, \"OK, we'll be out of your hair soon.\"\n\nRed Bull's Rainbow Bridge Julia DiMarco\n\nSpectacle. Where was this year's 12-foot vagina? Where were the pink snails and the artist living in a literal pigsty? The art on view during Basel week this year was relatively subdued. Sure, there were outliers, such as the 30-foot tall homage to Pac-Man called Rainbow Bridge . But there wasn't that one piece of art that got the whole city talking, as has happened in past years. Maybe that's a good thing; art week needs more intimate experiences. But for looky-loos in search of Instagram gold, Basel was a bust.\n\nCrowds at Scope Art Fair. Daniella Mia\n\nAgoraphobics. It goes without saying that Art Basel isn't a place for anyone afraid of crowds. But the congestion seemed especially bad this year, particularly at the fairs. The tents seem to be packing more galleries inside and adding flourishes like pop-up restaurants and lounges, leaving less space for viewers to take in the work. Meanwhile, a creepy sense of unease seemed to be one of the goals of Raw Pop Up's takeover of the shuttered Burdine's department store, from a haunted house-like entrance through a service elevator to the wild-eyed, unsettlingly jittery performers covered in ice-cream toppings like syrup and sprinkles, who screamed and laughed their way through the exhibit.

In November they welcomed their first daughter, Kaavia James, who was born via surrogate .

She \"could not let go of this idea of creating this life within me,\" she added, feeling there was a \"need to be pregnant for everybody, including myself.\"\n\nWade would get concerned about Union: \"I'm watching her do things to her body and to herself that it's getting to the point where it's not healthy,\" he told Oprah. \"And as I always told her: 'I want this baby just as much as you do, but I married you, and you are the most important thing to me.' So it came to a point where, you know, I started to feel a certain way about that because I didn't want something to happen to her.'\"\n\nEventually, Union and Wade opted for a surrogate, although Union said she still struggles with her feelings around using one: \"Did I miss\u2014did I fail in some kind of way? Did I\u2014am I defective in some kind of deep, you know, just\u2014am I defective in some kind of way? Am I less than in some kind of way? Am I less worthy in some kind of way?\"\n\nThe couple was involved throughout their surrogate's entire pregnancy, \"trying to feel as a part of the birth process as possible, since it's happening outside of both of us. But it's been a long\u2014a long journey,\" Union said. They were at the hospital when their surrogate was in labor, and described the experience of being in the delivery room with her and her husband as deeply bonding.\n\n\"Everyone's journey is different. Everyone's journey to surrogacy is different,\" Union said. By being open about their journey, the couple want to spark hope in couples going through similar circumstances\u2014and break some of the stigma that still surrounds infertility.\n\n\"So many people are suffering in silence and every time, when we're candid and transparent about our journeys, no matter what those journeys are, you are allowing people to be seen and heard and empowered in ways that they've never been,\" Union told Oprah.\n\nSince the show aired on OWN, people have taken to social media to praise the couple for their honesty and for bringing attention to this incredibly personal subject.\n\n\"Oprah and @itsgabrielleu are really on OWN discussing Black women\u2019s infertility, painful periods, and seeking help instead of suffering in silence.
